# Changelog

All notable changes to Robot Native Engine are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Manually triggered `Python wheels` workflow
  (`.github/workflows/wheels.yml`) builds `pip` wheels of `rne_py`: Ubuntu
  `manylinux_2_28` x86_64 (glibc 2.28, Ubuntu 20.04 and newer) and Windows
  x64. It installs each wheel on Ubuntu 22.04, the latest Ubuntu and Windows
  under Python 3.9 and 3.13, runs the release wheel smoke test, and uploads
  both wheels as the `rne_py-wheels` artifact.

### Removed

- Confirmed-dead `pub` items with zero references outside their defining file
  removed from `rne_core`, `rne_nav`, `rne_robot`, `rne_sensor`, `rne_data`,
  `rne_log`, `rne_slam`, `rne_assets`, `rne_planning`, `rne_plateau`,
  `rne_plugin`, `rne_urdf_import`, `rne_world`, `rne_dynamics`, `rne_legged`,
  `rne_physics`, and `rne_sumo`. Roughly forty items were unreachable from any
  call site (delete); another ~65 that were used only within their own crate
  are now `pub(crate)` instead of `pub`, shrinking the semver-relevant surface
  without changing behavior. Items with plausible external callers -
  importer entry points, error/result types required by another public
  function's signature, and anything referenced from `docs/*.md` - were kept
  public. `release/rust-api-baseline.toml` / `rust-api-additions-v1.toml` are
  untouched here per ADR-020/ADR-033; the retarget this entry asked for is the
  `0.4.0` release above, whose migration notes carry the full item list. See
  the PR description for the per-crate breakdown.

### Changed

- The lifelong SLAM GIF shows the robot's LiDAR as it drives: the scan it
  returns at each drawn pose (not the nearest keyframe), as rays from the
  LiDAR head, an outline joining adjacent returns, and the returns
  themselves. The mapping results are unchanged.
- The PLATEAU UAV showcase draws the imported LOD1 buildings with windowed
  facades (curtain-wall glass, concrete office, and residential fronts, one
  texture repeat per 2.4 m bay and 3.2 m storey counted from the ground) and
  textured roofs. The imported building triangles are unchanged; only
  texture coordinates are added. The glass strips and roof caps that followed
  collision boxes rather than building outlines, and floated beside the
  rotated LOD2 building, are no longer drawn in the UAV view. The quadrotor is
  drawn as a shelled body with battery, GNSS mast, folding arms, motor bells,
  spinning two-blade propellers, navigation lights, landing skids, and the
  camera gimbal the onboard RGB-D camera looks from. The README caption and
  metadata now report the flight the current code measures (56.0 m, 2.55 m
  minimum building clearance, zero collisions) instead of an older 76.6 m
  flight.

- The factory inspection showcase is a touch inspection at a belt conveyor.
  The belt is a kinematic body carrying three free dynamic parts by friction;
  it stops each within 1 mm of the inspection point, and the G1 lowers its
  right hand onto the part until the simulation reports contact between its
  fingertips and the part, rests it there, and lifts away. The fingertips
  meet each part 9-12 mm from the centre of its top face and 2 mm above it,
  stay in contact for 27-30 of the 30 hold steps, and move the part under
  1 mm. The arm follows damped least-squares inverse kinematics on the G1's
  chain, corrected by the measured fingertip position and by the pelvis's
  measured drift. The G1's hands carry no colliders in this scene, so the
  fingertips get a contact box over the hand mesh's fingertip vertices,
  carried on the forearm.
- The GitHub repository is renamed from `rsasaki0109/RoboSim` to
  `rsasaki0109/RobotNativeEngine`; GitHub redirects the old URLs. Links, the
  crate `repository` field, issue templates, and the release attestation
  identity (`release/artifact-attestation.toml`, `EXPECTED_ATTESTATION_REPOSITORY`)
  now name the new repository, so releases from v0.4.0 on are verified
  against it. The only published release, v0.1.0, predates the rename.
  Recorded evidence under `docs/evidence` keeps the URLs it was captured with.
- The vehicle dynamics GIF (example 49) is filmed from a fixed post outside
  the sweeper instead of from 72 m overhead. Both cars are GT coupés built
  from parts (body, glass, wing, lights, five-spoke wheels with discs and
  calipers) whose front wheels steer with the recorded steering angle and
  whose wheels spin with the distance covered; the kinematic car's steering
  is now recorded too, where it used to be drawn straight. The circuit is
  textured asphalt with kerbs, blue runoff and tyre walls; the run asserts
  both cars stay over 3 m from the drawn walls (closest 3.62 m). Trails are
  ribbons on the road. The simulation and its numbers are unchanged.

- `ColliderShape` and `Collider` are no longer `Copy`. Variable-size collider
  data (`ConvexHull`, `TriMesh`, `HeightField`, `Compound`) is stored behind
  `Arc`, so dependents must clone or borrow instead of implicitly copying.
  `rne_deformable::DeformableCollider` and `rne_robot`'s internal link collider
  follow the same change. This is source-breaking for downstream copies.

- Physics conformance catalog advances to v7 and the named tolerance registry to
  v5. `rapier.convex_hull.resting_contact` drops an axis-aligned convex hull onto
  a fixed ground body, and a default-feature test now compares the live
  `run_conformance()` output to the committed golden so the artifact cannot drift
  (this also refreshed a stale embedded `adapter_version`).

- `examples/109_go2_jump_sim` whole-body stance now feeds the measured joint
  velocities to `rne_wbc` and pulls its posture task toward the planned joint
  angles. The previous all-zero velocity feed over-drove the center of mass and
  inflated the jump apex while pitching the base about 1.08 rad; the corrected
  feed jumps 0.106 m with a 0.73 rad peak crouch lean (plan 0.250 m). New
  `--com-ff`, `--att-kp`, `--att-kd`, `--att-weight`, and `--apex` tuning knobs.

- Prune orphaned examples found unreferenced by name from README/docs/CI/xtask:
  `examples/107_go2_hop` (WBC jump superseded by the `106_go2_jump` ->
  `108_go2_jump_opt` -> `109_go2_jump_sim` DDP progression; `rne_wbc` is still
  demonstrated by `105_whole_body_control`), `examples/111_diff_drive_euroc_export`
  and `examples/112_house_3dgs_euroc_export` (precursor EuRoC exports superseded
  by the README-linked `113_drjohnson_euroc_export`), and `examples/18_readme_hero`
  (superseded by `docs/media/generate-hero.sh` now rendering the README hero via
  `32_lift_pick_place_hero`). `examples/110_collision_bake`,
  `examples/114_policy_artifact`, `examples/115_trainer`, and
  `examples/34_mobile_clutter_pick_place_e2e` were valuable but undocumented; they
  now have `examples/README.md` rows and (for the first three) cross-links from
  `docs/COLLISION_BAKE.md` / `docs/POLICY_ARTIFACT.md`.

- Prepare the `0.3.0` release candidate and retarget the immutable Rust API
  baseline. All workspace packages and exact internal dependency requirements
  now use `0.3.0`; release metadata, native archive/wheel names, provenance
  identities, Python API checks, and installation instructions advance
  together. `release/rust-api-baseline.toml` moves its frozen commit/tree to
  `d013957`/`6269a96` (the tip of `main` at bump time), absorbing breaking
  changes merged since the `0.2.0` freeze — notably `MobileManipulatorAction`
  (`crates/rne_ai/src/action.rs`) gaining public fields and the `rne_robot`
  API changes from PR #270 — into the new baseline rather than reverting them.
  `rne_nav`, `rne_slam`, and `rne_planning` drop `publish = false` and join the
  public, semver-checked release set (31 -> 34 packages), which also unblocks
  `cargo package -p rne_adapter_ros2`, a published crate that path-depends on
  `rne_nav`. Historical `0.1.0`/`0.2.0` fixtures remain unchanged and readable.

### Added

- Example 132's Go2 now turns the door's round knob before pushing the door
  open, and the door latches: a latch modelled in the example holds the leaf
  shut until the knob turns past 0.7 rad and catches it again when the leaf is
  shut with the knob at rest. The Go2 squares up to the knob, closes a
  two-finger gripper on it, holds it (welded to the hand) only once both
  fingers are measured on it and asserts both stay on it every held step,
  turns it with the wrist roll, pushes the leaf off its catch through it, and
  lets go; after walking through it pushes the door shut until the latch
  catches. All seven runs with the approach's stopping point moved over
  0.3 m pass. `unitree_go2_arm` becomes a generic 5-DOF arm with a two-finger
  gripper (1.46 kg, generated by `tools/generate_go2_arm_urdf.py`) in place of
  the 4-DOF push-pad arm, and `swing_door` gains the knob. See
  `docs/GO2_DOOR.md`.
- `UnitreeGo2ModelTrot::stand` holds the Go2 on all four feet at the position
  and heading where standing began (the next `step` resumes the trot), for
  work with an arm; a stepping body is pushed around by the arm's reactions.
- `rne_physics_rapier` welds a body that has its own revolute or prismatic
  multibody joint, such as a door knob on its spindle, with a `FixedJointDesc`:
  the weld becomes an extra impulse joint closing the loop, and the link's own
  joint keeps its coordinate, which `JointState` still reports. Such a weld
  used to be ignored.
- `examples/go2_indoor` dresses the Go2 examples' two rooms (wood and tile
  floors, rug, plastered walls with baseboards, kitchen island, bookshelf,
  crates, sofa, plants, counter) with procedural textures, drawing every model
  inside its collider so the robot's sensors see what is shown; the sofa,
  plants, and counter are new colliders in the scenes. Examples 131 and 132
  use it, read clearance from the scene's colliders, and match all 360 scan
  beams on a finer grid (localization 0.042 m and 0.081 m RMS).
- The README's lift section shows one GIF (goods-in to delivery); the
  two-truck relay moves to `docs/DEMOS.md`. The README's Go2 section shows
  only the door GIF, with the trot, Mid-360, and navigation GIFs in
  `docs/GO2_LOCOMOTION.md` and `docs/LIVOX_MID360.md`.
- Example 132 walks an arm-carrying Go2 (`unitree_go2_arm`: a generic 1.3 kg
  4-DOF arm with a push pad) through a damped swing door (`swing_door`) and
  shuts it behind itself, moving the door only by the pad's contact and
  steering only on its Mid-360 localization: the door opens to 87° and ends
  against its stop, and no other robot link touches it. See
  `docs/GO2_DOOR.md`. It replaces the office AGV on the README front-page
  showcase (the office AGV moves to `docs/DEMOS.md`). `UnitreeGo2ModelTrot::with_total_mass_kg` gives the
  trot a payload's weight.
- Example 131 navigates the Go2 between two rooms with no map given, on its
  recording-matched Mid-360: returns in the sensor frame at emission time,
  levelled by IMU attitude, de-skewed by drifting leg odometry, and cut into a
  2D scan for `rne_slam::Slam2d`; A* through unexplored space with replanning
  finds the doorway. Both goals are reached with 0.042 m RMS localization
  error while odometry alone drifts 7.1 m.
- Example 130 walks the Go2 around a room, steering to waypoints, with an
  upside-down Livox Mid-360 on its back: `UrdfSceneSim::sample_livox_mid360`
  scans the scene without the robot's own links (their returns come from the
  measured rig table), and `unitree_go2_mid360_mount` places the sensor. While
  walking, every floor-facing elevation band's no-return fraction stays
  between the two recordings'. `rne_sensor::LidarRaycaster` lets any raycast
  source, not only a `PhysicsBackend`, feed a scan.
- `rne_ai::UnitreeGo2ModelTrot` is example 126's model-based Go2 trot as a
  library controller, commanded by forward speed and yaw rate; example 126
  now runs on it with unchanged results.
- `rne_sensor::livox` models the Livox Mid-360 from real Go2 recordings:
  `LivoxMid360Pattern` reproduces its non-repetitive four-line firing pattern
  (a 91-term fit over the measured rotor and elevation-nod phases; 0.128°
  median error on a held-out recording, below the datasheet's 0.15°),
  `livox_mid360_spec` carries the datasheet range and detection figures, and
  `sample_livox_mid360` applies the measured Go2 rig occlusion
  (`assets/sensors/livox_mid360/go2_rig_occlusion.json`: four mount posts,
  5.4 % self returns, and the steep-angle floor loss) plus the measured
  near-range blanking, which makes a line return on every other firing along
  surfaces closer than 0.55 m. Upside down above a flat floor, per-band
  no-return fractions from 24° to 52° match the recording within 0.04.
  `sample_lidar_pattern_swept` and `LidarRay` cast any
  explicit ray pattern through the physics-aware LiDAR model. See
  `docs/LIVOX_MID360.md`.
- `MobileManipulatorSim::weld_grasp_in_place` holds an object where a linear
  gripper's pads caught it, once each pad is within a given distance of its
  faces, and closes the pads onto the faces;
  `set_linear_friction_assist` turns the linear friction assist off; and
  `set_solver_iterations` rebuilds the physics world with a different
  constraint-solver iteration count. Episode wrappers for all three. A
  linear gripper's pad that touches a part first now waits for the other.
- Lifelong SLAM in `rne_slam`: `build_recency_map` rebuilds the occupancy map
  from keyframes at the lifelong graph's current estimates, weighting each
  cell toward the latest session that observed it and reporting per session
  which cells appeared and vanished; `LifelongPoseGraph::prune_superseded`
  removes nodes a later session revisited, compounding their edges so the
  graph stays connected, with `reference_sessions` never pruned;
  `register_session_densely` registers every keyframe of a session against
  the prior map from one global recognition; and
  `LifelongPoseGraph::merge_session_onto_map` merges with the existing map held
  fixed. Example 127 maps a physics warehouse on four days while pallets move:
  9 of 9 changed pallets detected, 798 of 828 flagged cells on a changed
  pallet, the map within 3 cm of the building after rigid alignment, and the
  graph held at two days' nodes.
- Example 128 races four open-wheel cars for three laps on the tire-limited
  `VehicleDynamics` model from a reverse grid. Each car follows a
  minimum-curvature racing line at a friction-circle speed profile of its own
  grip and power, passes on the straights with a tow, and gives room as the
  car behind. Measured: four passes, the fastest car wins, cars never closer
  than 2.47 m centre to centre, none off the track. The cars are modelled from
  their parts and the circuit is dressed with CC0 Poly Haven asphalt, grass,
  tyres and barriers (`assets/props/polyhaven_racing`, fetched and pinned by
  `tools/prepare_polyhaven_warehouse.py --set racing`).
- Example 129 flies four racing drones for three laps of an eight-gate night
  course on `MultirotorFlight`, each chasing a point on the course at its own
  curvature speed profile in its own lane of the gate opening, from a pursuit
  start. Every gate crossing is checked against the opening. Measured: 99
  crossings, none outside, tightest 0.56 m from the frame; drones never
  closer than 0.80 m; six passes on the final lap; the fastest drone wins.
  The quads are modelled from their parts and filmed with chase cameras.

- The Navigation showcase (`docs/media/showcase-nav.gif`) is a shared
  corridor. A second AGV comes the other way, a pedestrian crosses from a
  doorway, and a hand truck stands in the aisle. None of them is on the orange
  AGV's map; all are kinematic bodies its LiDAR hits (raised to 360 rays for
  this). It segments the returns the static map does not explain, tracks them
  with `ObstacleTracker`, writes the tracks into the costmap (moving ones swept
  2 s ahead) for `plan_path` at 5 Hz, follows the route with pure pursuit, and
  gives way through `avoid_velocities`. The second AGV follows its lane with the
  same avoidance, given the other agents' true positions. Measured: footprints
  at least 0.32 m apart, 0.23 m clear of the pedestrian after a 2.2 s stop,
  0.05 m docking error. The pedestrian is the Khronos Rigged Figure walking;
  the hand truck is the scanned Poly Haven prop; the second AGV carries a tote
  stack, which is also what brings it up into the scan plane.

- The warehouse examples (123, 125) are dressed with scanned CC0 props from
  Poly Haven -- the carried case is a scanned cardboard box of the same size,
  racks hold boxes and crates, and the site has carts, a hand truck, an
  extinguisher, a distribution board, fluorescent battens, a steel shelf unit
  and a shipping shutter, with profiled steel cladding on the walls
  (`tools/prepare_polyhaven_warehouse.py` fetches and pins them;
  `assets/props/polyhaven_warehouse/README.md`). The forklifts are redrawn as
  autonomous forklifts: rounded counterweight, two-stage mast with lift and
  tilt cylinders and chains, lattice backrest, L-shaped tines, wheels with
  hubs, a LiDAR tower, corner safety scanners, status lights and the blue
  floor spot. Stands and the lift car are detailed too. Physics is unchanged.
- `tools/encode_gif.py`: frame-differenced GIF encoding with one shared
  palette. The relay GIF is 0.86 MB this way against 7-13 MB through ffmpeg.

- `UrdfSceneSim::set_fixed_delta`: sets the physics step every `step_*` call
  advances by (scenes default to 60 Hz). Torque-level controllers that close a
  force or Cartesian loop per step need 500 Hz to 1 kHz.
- Example 126, `126_go2_heading_steer`: the Go2 with its feet attached
  (`unitree_go2_jump`) walks head first through an S on a 500 Hz model-based
  trot -- foot Jacobians from the link frames, stance `τ = −Jᵀf` for weight,
  height, speed and yaw rate, Raibert swing placement with Cartesian PD -- and
  a heading loop. Held headings 0.037 rad RMS over 8.5 m; gated by `--smoke`
  in the locomotion smoke partition. Renders `docs/media/go2-heading-steer.gif`.

- `rne_nav::Elevator::hold_doors`: a door-edge / light-curtain input. While
  the doors are open it restarts the dwell, while they are closing it reverses
  them, and otherwise it does nothing.
- Example 125, `125_warehouse_relay`: two forklift AGVs hand one case across
  two floors through the lift. The ground-floor truck takes the case off the
  goods-in stand, presses the call button, turns round and sets the case on a
  stand inside the car; the car carries the case up alone; the upper-floor
  truck forks it out, turns round and sets it on the outbound bay. Gated
  headlessly (`--smoke`): each truck stays on its floor, the car never moves
  with a truck in it, nothing is in the doorway while the doors are not fully
  open, and the case ends seated on the outbound stand with the tines out of
  it. Renders `docs/media/warehouse-relay.gif`.
- `rne_slam::lio_inertial::LioInertialEkf` extends the tightly-coupled iEKF to a
  15-DoF error state (`[rotation, translation, velocity, gyro_bias,
  accel_bias]`): IMU samples propagate pose, velocity, and biases with the
  error-state transition, and raw point-to-plane residuals correct all of them
  through the iterated information-form update. The covariance is projected back
  to positive definite (Gershgorin shift) so long stationary runs stay stable.

- `rne_slam::lio_iekf::LioIekf` is the tightly-coupled counterpart to `LioEkf`:
  it feeds raw point-to-plane residuals into an iterated information-form update
  (`(P^-1 + H/sigma^2) delta = -g/sigma^2`, `P <- (P^-1 + H/sigma^2)^-1`) and
  re-linearizes at the current pose. The state is pose-only; velocity and bias
  estimation inside the filter remain future work.

- `rne_ai::ppo` adds a deterministic PPO optimizer for continuous Gaussian
  policies: `PpoTrainer` (policy + value networks, seeded rollouts, GAE,
  clipped surrogate with value and entropy terms) over a `PpoEnv`, with
  `to_policy_artifact` export. Tests train a continuous bandit to its target and
  verify determinism. SAC and discrete/visual policies remain future work.

- `rne_ai::neural` adds a dependency-free differentiable core: `NeuralNet` (a
  deterministic dense MLP with hand-written backpropagation), `Adam`, and
  `to_policy_artifact` export. Weights are seeded from `DeterministicRng`, and
  `backward` returns per-layer `LayerGradient`s verified against finite
  differences. On-policy optimizers (PPO/SAC) build on this module.

- `rne_slam::lio_ekf::LioEkf` adds a covariance-aware LiDAR-inertial front-end: a
  6-DoF pose EKF where IMU preintegration predicts and inflates the covariance,
  a point-to-plane scan-to-map match supplies a pose measurement with the
  registration information diagonal, and a Kalman update fuses them
  (`pose_covariance`, `predicted_covariance_trace`). It is a loosely-coupled pose
  EKF; a tightly-coupled iterated EKF is a later increment.

- `rne_urdf_import` resolves visual `<material name="...">` references against
  robot-level `<material name><color rgba/></material>` definitions. An inline
  `<color>` still wins, and an unknown name leaves the color unset.

- `rne_traffic::lane_change` composes IDM and MOBIL into `mobil_idm_decision`
  (`MobilNeighbor` describes a lane's leader/follower): it computes IDM
  accelerations for the subject and both followers before and after a candidate
  change, then applies the MOBIL criterion. Autonomous lane selection is not yet
  wired into the runtime; the OpenSCENARIO lane change remains scripted.

- `KinematicTrafficConfig` gains an opt-in `car_following: CarFollowingModel`
  field. It defaults to `Kinematic` so recorded replays are unchanged; selecting
  `CarFollowingModel::Idm(IdmParams)` switches runtime-owned actors to the
  Intelligent Driver Model using the same-route leader speed, still clamped by
  signal and junction-reservation control. Invalid IDM parameters are rejected
  during config validation.

- `rne_mjcf` import fidelity: body and geom rotation via `quat`, `euler`, or
  `axisangle` now converts to URDF `rpy` instead of being rejected; `capsule`
  geoms approximate a cylinder; and `<asset><mesh>` referenced by
  `type="mesh"` geoms emit URDF mesh geometry. `zaxis`, free/ball/universal
  joints, and `fromto`/`plane`/`ellipsoid` geoms still fail closed.

- `rne_traffic` gains standard microscopic traffic models as deterministic pure
  functions: `car_following` (Intelligent Driver Model via `IdmParams` /
  `idm_acceleration`, and the Krauss safe-velocity model via `KraussParams` /
  `krauss_safe_speed` / `krauss_new_speed`) and `lane_change` (MOBIL incentive,
  safety criterion, and decision via `mobil_incentive` / `mobil_safe` /
  `mobil_should_change`). The runtime keeps its kinematic default so replays are
  unchanged; these models are opt-in building blocks.

- New offline `rne_usd` crate imports a strict ASCII `.usda` subset into
  world-space triangle meshes: nested `Xform`/`Mesh` prims, `xformOp:translate`
  and `xformOp:transform` (rigid), `points`, `faceVertexCounts`,
  `faceVertexIndices`, and `primvars:displayColor`, with fan triangulation and
  OBJ export. `rne-asset usd-import <INPUT.usda> --out-dir DIR` writes one OBJ
  per mesh. Unsupported constructs fail closed.

- `rne_slam` gains a point-to-plane and LiDAR-inertial front-end: `point_to_plane`
  (`VoxelPointIndex` deterministic nearest neighbour, `estimate_normals`
  neighbourhood PCA, `IcpPointToPlane::align` for scan-to-map registration with
  an information diagonal) and `lio` (`LioOdometry` preintegrates IMU to predict
  the next pose, registers each scan to a maintained local map with
  point-to-plane ICP, and records keyframes plus `PoseGraph3dEdge`s). All
  deterministic and backend-neutral.

- `rne_slam` gains 3D LiDAR-inertial building blocks: `se3` (SE(3) exp/log,
  SO(3) helpers, left Jacobian and inverse), `imu_preintegration`
  (`ImuPreintegrator` folding gyroscope/accelerometer samples into a
  pose-independent `PreintegratedDelta` with gravity-aware `predict`), and
  `pose_graph3d` (`PoseGraph3d` SE(3) Gauss-Newton with numerical Jacobians and
  dense Cholesky, anchoring one node). All are deterministic and backend-neutral.

- `rne_ai` gains a native, dependency-free, seeded trainer (`cem_train`,
  `CemConfig`, `CemResult`) that maximizes a deterministic fitness function over
  a flat parameter vector using the cross-entropy method. `MlpPolicyTemplate`
  describes a dense MLP and maps between the flat vector and a `PolicyArtifact`
  (`parameter_count`, `to_artifact`), so trained weights export directly to the
  loadable `.rne.policy.json` format. New `examples/115_trainer` trains a linear
  policy to convergence and writes the artifact.

- `rne_ai::PolicyArtifact` loads learned policies as versioned data
  (`.rne.policy.json`, schema v1) instead of freezing weights as Rust constants.
  The format is a dense feed-forward network with explicit activations and output
  clamps; `evaluate` is a deterministic `f64` forward pass, and a single identity
  layer expresses a linear CEM policy. `DiffDriveArtifactPolicy` binds an
  artifact to the fixed 12-value diff-drive observation encoding and implements
  `LocomotionPolicy` / `Policy<DiffDriveEpisode>`. New
  `examples/114_policy_artifact` authors, saves, reloads, and evaluates one.

- `ColliderShape` gains `ConvexHull`, `TriMesh`, `HeightField`, and `Compound`
  (plus `CompoundPart`). Rapier converts each with `SharedShape::convex_hull`,
  `trimesh`, `heightfield`, and `compound`, guarding degenerate input with a
  typed `PhysicsError::InvalidColliderShape`. MuJoCo rejects non-primitive
  colliders until Mesh/hfield compilation lands; deformable contact,
  self-collision, and URDF AABB fallbacks approximate them as bounding spheres.

- New offline `rne_collision_bake` crate performs a deterministic voxel
  decomposition of a triangle mesh into a `Compound` of axis-aligned boxes
  (surface voxelization with a triangle/box separating-axis test, then a
  lexicographic greedy merge). It emits a versioned `.rne.collision.json`
  sidecar (`rne_collision_bake`, schema v1) with save/load/validate and a
  `sidecar_path` helper. `rne_urdf_import` loads a sidecar next to a mesh
  collision element and replaces the AABB fallback with the scaled compound.

- `rne-asset bake-collision <MESH> --out <PATH> [--max-cells-per-axis N]
  [--max-parts N]` authors collision sidecars from `.stl`/`.obj` meshes.

- `examples/110_collision_bake` bakes an L-shaped prism, writes the sidecar, and
  drops a sphere onto the baked collider through Rapier.

- `VehicleDynamics::four_wheel` (an optional `FourWheelVehicleSpec`) replaces the
  single-track axle abstraction with four explicit wheels when set: each front wheel
  gets a blended Ackermann steer angle, each wheel carries its own normal load and slip
  angle (`vy + r x`, `vx + r z`), and the axle force and yaw moment are the explicit
  per-wheel sums. Directional lateral load transfer loads the outer side by the sign of
  `vx r`; per-wheel telemetry is exposed on `wheel_slip_rad` / `wheel_saturated`, and
  the axle slip fields become the per-wheel mean. This is a **deliberately lower-order
  model, not a measurement**: there is no roll degree of freedom, the tire stays linear
  and friction-saturated, and the steered front tires' longitudinal force component and
  any aligning moment are omitted. `None` by default keeps the single-track model
  bit-for-bit identical, the field is skipped when serializing a `VehicleDynamics` that
  does not set it, and `lateral_load_transfer` is ignored while the four-wheel model is
  active.

- `rne_mobility_benchmark` combined suspension-and-tire identification
  application (`identified_suspension_tire`): fits one suspension
  `SuspensionIdentificationDataset`, replays one `IdentifiedTireProfileEvidence`,
  and applies the fitted `SuspensionStrutSpec` plus the profile's
  `CombinedSlipTireSpec` to the exact same suspended four-wheel road-excitation
  task on Rapier and MuJoCo. New self-verifying artifacts
  `rne_mobility_identified_suspension_tire_trace` and
  `rne_mobility_identified_suspension_tire_evidence` bind both source chains,
  the applied specs, the traces, the cross-backend comparison, and a digest.
  New CLI backends `identified-suspension-tire-rapier` and
  `identified-suspension-tire-compare` take `--input <suspension dataset>` and
  `--tire-profile <profile>`. `run_road_excitation_trace_with_specs` adds the
  parameterized wheel-plant entry point; `RoadExcitationTrace` now validates its
  retained suspension and tire specs as individually valid (the wrapper evidence
  binds them), matching the earlier suspension parameterization, while
  `IdentifiedSuspensionRoadEvidence` explicitly binds the baseline wheel plant so
  its guarantee is unchanged and the baseline trace stays byte-for-byte
  identical. Fixtures are synthetic; the combined artifact never asserts physical
  qualification.

- `VehicleDynamics::cornering_stiffness_load_sensitivity` (an optional
  `CorneringStiffnessLoadSensitivity`): lets the planar dynamic bicycle model's
  per-axle cornering stiffness scale with the axle's instantaneous load,
  instead of staying constant while only the friction saturation limit moves
  with load transfer. It reuses `CombinedSlipTireSpec`'s load-ratio clamp and
  `load_sensitivity_per_load_ratio` functional form (factored into a shared
  `capped_load_ratio` helper) with the slope sign flipped, since cornering
  stiffness rises with load where tire friction falls with it; stiffness stays
  exactly at its declared value when the axle is at its own static load. This
  is a **model refinement of a deliberately simple linear tire, not a
  measurement** — it has not been validated against measured vehicle or tire
  data, and the affine/clamped shape is chosen for consistency with the
  existing tire law, not fit to data. The field is absent (`None`) by default,
  which keeps every existing constant-stiffness trajectory bit-for-bit
  identical; serialized `VehicleDynamics` values omit the field entirely
  (`skip_serializing_if`) unless it is set.

- `rne_wbc` opt-in torque-constrained solve (`WholeBodyConfig::enforce_torque_limits`)
  and an optional feed-forward joint torque reference
  (`WholeBodyController::solve_with_torque_reference`). The joint torques join
  the unknowns and are box-constrained inside the solve (projected-gradient
  least squares), so the controller returns the best feasible compromise
  instead of clipping the unconstrained torques afterward. On the Go2 jump it
  shows the launch and the base attitude cannot both be served by the 23.7 Nm
  budget: the constrained optimum stays level but never leaves the ground.

- `rne_wbc::PostureTask` optional `desired_joint_velocities` and
  `desired_joint_accelerations`, so a posture task can track a reference
  trajectory at the acceleration level instead of only holding a position.

- `rne_oc::ContactImplicitArticulatedDynamics` and `CompliantContactModel`: a
  contact-implicit dynamics model where the candidate contact points decide at
  every step whether they push, from their penetration of a ground plane (a
  smooth normal force plus regularized Coulomb friction). The contact schedule
  is discovered from the trajectory instead of supplied as phases, so an
  optimizer can plan a takeoff and a landing with one fixed candidate set. Unit
  tests cover a freely falling body, a body caught by its candidate points, and
  the normal-force clamp.
- `examples/109_go2_jump_sim --wbc-stance` now removes the jump's forward pitch
  instead of trading against it. The stance feed passes the plan's torque to
  `solve_with_torque_reference` with low center-of-mass and attitude gains
  (the open-source NMPC-feed-forward plus low-gain tracking recipe for
  torque-controlled legged robots), and during flight the legs blend toward the
  crouch pose and release over the last 30% of the flight (`--tuck`, default
  `1`). The flight targets now also restore the position motors after the
  torque-mode stance feed, which is why the previous flight targets were
  silently ignored. The example reports `liftoff=true` with a peak lean of
  `0.325` rad and a `44` mm foot clearance, against `0.73` rad before;
  `--no-ff-torque` restores the old behavior (lean up to `2.4` rad).
- Added `docs/media/go2-jump.gif` and its reduced-motion still, with a README
  entry under the native optimal control section, now that the Go2 jump leaves
  the ground without the forward pitch.
- `examples/109_go2_jump_sim --mpc`: receding-horizon replanning of the Go2 jump
  from the measured state (warm-started, `--mpc-period`, `--mpc-iters`). It
  closes the loop on the plan but does not remove the forward pitch, which the
  whole-body solve produces, so the pitch is not a plan/plant drift.
- `rne_oc::ActuatorLimitCost`: a cost-model wrapper that adds a differentiable
  hinge penalty on joint velocity limit violations, so a joint speed bound acts
  as a soft state constraint on top of the existing running/terminal cost.
  `examples/109_go2_jump_sim` exposes it through `--vel-weight`; on the Go2 jump
  it reduces the peak planned joint speed from `44.0` to `31.0` rad/s, against a
  URDF thigh limit of `15.7` rad/s.
- `weld_fixed_children` URDF articulation option. When enabled, links reachable
  only through fixed joints (for example the Unitree Go2 foot and calf shells)
  join the reduced-coordinate multibody instead of becoming free rigid bodies
  that fall off the robot. It defaults to off for bit-identical legacy
  behavior; the mass-matched jump robot opts in. With the flag on, the Go2 foot
  frame matches the planner's URDF forward kinematics and the optimized jump
  lifts off (0.144 m whole-body-control jump height) for the first time.
- `examples/109_go2_jump_sim --debug-fk` compares the planner's URDF forward
  kinematics with the plant's articulation frames. It isolated the failed jump
  transfer: the base and the chain through the calf matched to machine
  precision, but the Go2 foot link sat `0.138` m from the calf instead of the
  URDF's `0.213` m, because `rne_urdf_import` excluded fixed-only children from
  the physics multibody.

- `rne_oc` control-limited DDP: `DdpConfig::control_lower`/`control_upper` project
  the feedforward onto the control box and zero the feedback on saturated
  coordinates. `examples/108_go2_jump_opt` now produces an
  **actuator-realizable** Go2 jump: a 0.372 m apex with the torque saturated at
  ±23.7 Nm, gap-free contact dynamics, and natural joint angles.

- `rne_oc` Richardson-extrapolated dynamics Jacobians (`O(epsilon^4)`), which
  fixed the conditioning of the phased Go2 jump: `examples/108_go2_jump_opt` now
  converges a crouch→push→flight jump reaching a 0.327 m apex with a feasible
  (gap-free) trajectory and natural joint angles. The unconstrained solve uses
  ~57.5 Nm, so control-limit constraints are the next requirement.

- `rne_oc` action models: `CostModel` is now node-aware and `PhaseCostSchedule`
  gives each phase of a contact sequence its own quadratic running cost, the
  Crocoddyl action-model analogue. Controllers can pull toward a crouch during
  a loading phase and an apex during flight.

- Declared-inertia Go2 jump scene (`assets/scenes/unitree_go2_jump.rne.scene.toml`)
  so the simulator and the optimal-control planner share the same masses, and
  `rne_oc` hardening: dynamics-derivative failures and the FDDP feasible-rollout
  projection are tolerated instead of aborting the solve.

- `examples/109_go2_jump_sim`: plans a Go2 jump from the settled simulator
  state and replays the joint trajectory with stiff position control. The plan
  is valid (see example 108) but does not yet transfer: the simulator uses
  collider-augmented masses and a Rapier contact model, so the feet do not
  leave the ground. Recorded as the measured plan-to-sim gap.

- `examples/108_go2_jump_opt`: optimizes a Unitree Go2 jump over a fixed
  stance→flight contact sequence with the native FDDP solver. The floating
  base reaches a 0.32 m apex with near-zero terminal velocity, torques stay
  within ±4.84 Nm, and the contact dynamics are satisfied to machine
  precision. This is the first model-based jump generated end-to-end by the
  native dynamics/optimal-control stack.

- `rne_robot`: optional analytic longitudinal load transfer for
  `LongitudinalMobilityPlantSpec`. The reduced longitudinal mobility plant
  previously fed the tire a static `normal_load_per_driven_wheel_n`, so
  `CombinedSlipTireSpec::load_sensitivity_per_load_ratio` never moved from its
  reference-load value inside that plant. A new opt-in
  `longitudinal_load_transfer: Option<LongitudinalLoadTransferSpec>` (fields
  `wheelbase_m`, `cg_height_m`, `driven_axle`) instead derives the driven
  wheel's per-step normal load from the plant's own longitudinal acceleration
  via the classic rigid-body relation `delta_F_z = m * a_x * h_cg / L`, split
  across `driven_wheel_count` and clamped non-negative for wheel lift. This is
  an analytic model only -- no suspension dynamics, no lateral/cornering
  transfer, and no measured-vehicle validation. It is longitudinal-only and
  bit-for-bit identical to prior plant behavior when absent, which existing
  serialized specs and physical-qualification evidence (PR #253-#257) depend
  on. See
  [`MOBILITY_LONGITUDINAL_BENCHMARK_V1.md`](docs/MOBILITY_LONGITUDINAL_BENCHMARK_V1.md).

- `rne_dynamics` impulsive contact reset: `impulse_velocity` solves the impulse
  KKT system to reset joint velocities when new contacts are established.
  `rne_oc` gains an FDDP warm start (`DdpConfig::keep_gaps_open`) that opens
  dynamics gaps early and then polishes with DDP from a feasible rollout, and
  `ContactSequenceDynamics` now applies the impact reset automatically when a
  phase adds contacts. Tests cover an infeasible-start FDDP solve and a
  contact-point velocity arrest.

- `rne_dynamics`: constrained forward dynamics with rigid point contacts.
  `constrained_forward_dynamics` solves the contact KKT system
  (mass matrix, contact Jacobians, and bias accelerations) so active points
  neither accelerate nor separate, with a small contact-compliance
  regularization for redundant contacts. `rne_oc` adds
  `ConstrainedArticulatedDynamics` and a node-dependent
  `ContactSequenceDynamics` over a caller-provided phase schedule, plus a
  `ShootingDynamics` trait.

- `rne_oc`: a backend-neutral multi-contact optimal-control crate. It provides a
  discrete `DiscreteDynamics`/`CostModel` shooting problem, a deterministic DDP
  solver with Levenberg-Marquardt regularization and a backtracking line search,
  central-difference dynamics derivatives, a diagonal `QuadraticCost`, and an
  `ArticulatedDynamics` adapter over `rne_dynamics::forward_dynamics`. Tests pin a
  double-integrator regulation and a single-joint pendulum swing-up solved through
  the native dynamics (`docs/architecture/015_native_optimal_control.md`).


- `rne_legged::centroidal`: the classical centroidal layer for dynamic maneuvers.
  It provides a single-rigid-body model and state, a weighted least-squares
  `distribute_contact_forces` that matches a desired net wrench and projects each
  contact into its Coulomb friction cone, `raibert_foot_placement`, a
  minimal-jerk `SwingTrajectory` with apex, and ballistic flight helpers. The
  formulation follows the open-source centroidal controllers in `yxyang/cajun`
  and `go2-convex-mpc`.

- `rne_wbc`: a backend-neutral whole-body controller. It solves a weighted
  inverse-dynamics problem over joint accelerations and contact wrenches with
  the floating-base equations of motion and contact no-slip rows, an optional
  center-of-mass task and joint posture task, column-equilibrated normal
  equations, Coulomb friction-cone projection, and torque recovery with optional
  limits. It builds on new `rne_dynamics` support: `link_motions` (world-frame
  link motion and bias acceleration) and `frame_jacobian` (a base-twist
  consistent spatial Jacobian), with `com_jacobian` moved onto the same
  convention. Unit tests cover friction projection, weight support, and
  determinism; `examples/105_whole_body_control` runs the controller on the
  floating-base 12-DoF Unitree Go2 (`docs/architecture/014_whole_body_control.md`).

- `rne_legged`: a backend-neutral legged walking template layer. It provides the
  Linear Inverted Pendulum Model and Divergent Component of Motion
  (`capture_point`, `dcm_step`, `propagate_constant_zmp`), closed-form
  capture-point foot placement (`footstep_from_dcm`), a deterministic
  Kajita-style ZMP preview controller (`ZmpPreviewController`) that solves the
  discrete Riccati equation and derives preview gains, footstep plans with
  smooth double-support transitions and start/finish weight shifts
  (`plan_straight_walk`, `FootstepPlan`, `ZmpSegment`), and full center-of-mass
  walking patterns (`plan_walking_pattern`). Unit tests cover the analytic
  capture-point and DCM closed forms, footstep/DCM inversion, preview
  stabilization and tracking, and deterministic bounded patterns.
  `examples/104_legged_pattern` plans an eight-step walk and demonstrates
  capture-point push recovery (`docs/architecture/013_legged_templates.md`).

- `rne_dynamics`: a backend-neutral articulated-body dynamics crate. It derives a
  spatial-algebra tree model from the `rne_robot` link/joint graph and provides
  the composite-rigid-body mass matrix (`mass_matrix`), recursive Newton-Euler
  inverse dynamics (`rnea`) with gravity/velocity bias (`non_linear_effects`,
  `gravity_torque`), deterministic forward dynamics (`forward_dynamics`), the
  center of mass (`center_of_mass`), and the center-of-mass Jacobian
  (`com_jacobian`). Fixed- and floating-base trees are supported; the floating
  base uses the body-frame spatial twist convention. Analytic unit tests cover
  the two-link closed forms, `rnea` linearity in `qdd`, mass-matrix symmetry and
  definiteness, the floating spatial inertia and gravity wrench, and energy
  conservation of a torque-free double pendulum. `examples/103_dynamics_diagnostics`
  runs the same layer on the floating-base 12-DoF Unitree Go2 (`docs/architecture/012_dynamics.md`).

- `rne.unitree_g1.joint_locomotion.v1`: a joint-space Unitree G1 locomotion
  episode with a 12-leg-joint residual action and the OSS projected-gravity /
  gait-clock observation and velocity-tracking / air-time reward recipe, plus a
  pyo3 binding (`rne_py.UnitreeG1JointLocomotionEpisode`), a `std::thread`
  parallel batch (`VectorizedUnitreeG1JointLocomotionEnv`,
  `rne_py.UnitreeG1JointBatch`), and a Gymnasium + Stable-Baselines3 PPO
  example (`examples/93_g1_joint_locomotion_rl`). This replaces the
  three-parameter scripted stepper as the trainable G1 boundary; from-scratch
  walking remains compute-bound on CPU (see `docs/G1_LOCOMOTION.md`).

- `rne_robot::kinematics`: a MoveIt-inspired inverse kinematics solver boundary.
  `KinematicsSolver` lets solvers be swapped by name, `IkRequest` carries the end
  link, target pose, seed, and options, `DampedLeastSquaresSolver` wraps the
  existing solver as the built-in implementation, and `KinematicsSolverRegistry`
  resolves solvers deterministically while rejecting duplicate or empty names.
  `RobotState` snapshots named joint positions and velocities in DoF order,
  computes forward kinematics, and seeds a solver through `solve_ik`.

- `rne_robot::kinematics`: mimic and passive joints. `MimicJoint` mirrors the
  URDF `<mimic>` tag and is derived from its source joint instead of counting as
  a degree of freedom; forward kinematics and the geometric Jacobian apply the
  chain rule (the source column is scaled by the multiplier and summed with the
  source joint's own contribution). `PassiveJoint` marks a non-actuated joint
  that keeps its degree of freedom, with `passive_joint_entities`,
  `mimic_joint_entities`, and `is_mimic_joint` accessors. `rne_urdf_import` now
  wires a parsed URDF `<mimic>` element into a `MimicJoint` component on the
  follower joint.

- `rne_robot::self_collision`: MoveIt-inspired collision queries. The new
  `AllowedCollisionMatrix` skips explicit link pairs on top of structural
  parent/child exclusion, `signed_distance` gives the pairwise signed distance,
  and `SelfCollisionChecker::{distance, check_path}` expose `distanceRobot` and
  `isPathValid` style queries. `CollisionWorld` holds world-space primitives and
  reports robot-vs-world contacts and distances without a physics backend.

- `rne_planning`: a new backend-neutral joint-space motion-planning crate
  inspired by MoveIt's architecture but free of MoveIt, ROS, physics-backend, and
  renderer dependencies. It provides `PlanningScene`, `GoalConstraint`,
  `MotionPlanRequest` / `MotionPlanResponse`, `RobotTrajectory`, a `MotionPlanner`
  trait with `PlannerRegistry` and `PlanningPipeline`, and built-in
  `JointInterpolationPlanner` and deterministic, explicitly seeded
  `RrtConnectPlanner` implementations. See
  [ADR 028](docs/adr/028-native-motion-planning.md) and
  [joint-space motion planning](docs/architecture/011_joint_motion_planning.md).

- `rne_planning` planning request adapters: a `PlanningRequestAdapter` boundary
  with `FixStartStateBounds` (clamps the start state to joint limits) and
  `AddTimeParameterization` (retimes trajectories to `JointLimits::max_velocity`
  and `PlanningOptions::velocity_scaling_factor`). `PlanningPipeline` now runs
  its adapter chain before and after planning. `time_parameterize_with_acceleration`
  adds per-joint `PlanningOptions::acceleration_limits`: each segment uses a
  stop-and-go trapezoidal profile (triangular for short moves) and falls back to
  piecewise-constant velocity when no acceleration limit is declared.

- `rne_planning` planning groups: `PlanningGroup` names a kinematic chain or an
  explicit joint set (SRDF analogue) and stores its degree-of-freedom indices.
  `PlanningScene` stores groups by name, and `MotionPlanRequest::with_group`
  scopes a plan to one. Sampling, steering, interpolation, and inverse kinematics
  (`KinematicModel::inverse_kinematics_active`, reduced active-column Jacobian)
  are restricted to the group while inactive joints hold their start value.
  `KinematicModel::chain_joints` and `dof_index_of_joint` expose the chain graph.

- `rne_robot::kinematics` inverse-kinematics robustness and metrics:
  `KinematicsSolver::search_position_ik` adds deterministic, seeded random
  restarts (the MoveIt `searchPositionIK` analogue) that respect an active-joint
  mask, `KinematicModel::manipulability` reports `sqrt(det(J J^T))`, and
  `joint_limit_distance` reports the nearest finite joint bound. `rne_planning`
  exposes the restart budget as `PlanningOptions::ik_restarts`.

- `rne_planning` constraints: `GoalConstraint::Orientation` adds an
  orientation-only goal, resolved by driving only the orientation Jacobian rows
  (`IkOptions::solve_position` / `solve_orientation`). `PathConstraint`
  (orientation or position of an end link) is checked at every sampled
  configuration through `PlanningScene::is_motion_valid_with`, and every built-in
  planner honors it via `MotionPlanRequest::with_path_constraint`.

- `rne_planning` roadmap planning: `PrmPlanner` samples collision-free
  configurations, connects nearest neighbours with collision-checked edges, and
  searches with Dijkstra (`prm`). Sampling and edge choice are seeded and
  deterministic.

- README motion-planning media: `examples/102_motion_planning_media` loads the
  checked-in RNE-converted OpenArm v2 left arm (7-DOF, GLB meshes), plans a
  collision-free swing around a collision object with RRT-Connect, and plays the
  trajectory through the real wgpu renderer to write
  `docs/media/motion-planning.{gif,png}`. `--smoke` runs
  the planner headlessly and asserts straight joint interpolation is blocked
  while RRT-Connect is feasible. The README "Native motion planning" section
  embeds the capture.

- `rne_planning` batch informed planning: `BitStarPlanner` (`bit_star`) samples
  in batches, connects each batch to a growing roadmap with collision-checked
  edges, runs A* after every batch, and switches to informed ellipsoid sampling
  once a solution exists (a BIT*-style batch informed planner).

- `rne_planning` informed sampling: `InformedRrtStarPlanner`
  (`informed_rrt_star`) starts as RRT* and, once a solution is found, restricts
  sampling to the informed ellipsoid of configurations that could still improve
  the best cost (the OMPL informed-sampling idea). Deterministic for a seed.

- `rne_robot::self_collision` voxel maps: `VoxelGridObject` is an Octomap-style
  dense occupancy grid built from a bitmap or a point cloud (`from_points`).
  Occupied voxels are tested as cuboids against robot spheres, capsules, and
  cuboids and block line-of-sight segments. `CollisionWorld::{add_voxel_grid,
  remove_voxel_grid, voxel_grid}` manage them, and
  `PlanningScene::add_occupancy_map` accepts a point cloud.

- `rne_robot::self_collision` mesh collision: `MeshCollisionObject` adds
  triangle geometry to a `CollisionWorld` (`add_mesh_object` /
  `remove_mesh_object` / `mesh_object`). Meshes are tested against robot spheres
  and capsules with exact point/segment-to-triangle distance, against world
  segments with ray/triangle intersection, and against cuboids via the mesh AABB.
  `PlanningScene::add_mesh_collision_object` forwards it to planning.

- `rne_robot::kinematics` analytic IK: `AnalyticTwoLinkSolver`
  (`analytic_two_link`) detects a planar two-revolute chain and solves both
  elbow configurations in closed form (an IKFast-style plugin), returning
  `NotConverged` for any other structure. `KinematicsSolverRegistry` now exposes
  three built-in solvers by name.

- `rne_robot::kinematics` floating base: a `FloatingBase` marker on a robot's
  base link prepends six degrees of freedom `(x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)` to the
  kinematic model. `base_dof`, `movable_dof_names`, `joint_limits`, forward
  kinematics, the Jacobian, active-mask IK, clamping, and `RobotState` all
  account for the base, so a mobile manipulator can plan base and arm together.

- `rne_planning` STOMP planner: `StompPlanner` (`stomp`) is a stochastic
  trajectory optimizer that draws seeded noisy rollouts, weights them by a
  softmax of their smoothness-plus-obstacle cost, and moves to the cost-weighted
  average with fixed endpoints, returning the best trajectory seen.

- `rne_planning` hybrid planner: `HybridPlanner` (`hybrid`) runs the global
  RRT-Connect planner and then refines the trajectory with the CHOMP-inspired
  optimizer, mirroring MoveIt's hybrid planning while staying deterministic.

- `rne_robot::kinematics` second solver: `JacobianTransposeSolver`
  (`jacobian_transpose`) adds a stable `dq = gain * J^T e` solver with a
  backtracking line search and active-mask support. `KinematicsSolverRegistry`'s
  built-ins now expose damped least squares and Jacobian transpose by name.

- `rne_planning` workspace-bounds adapters: `PlanningScene::set_workspace_bounds`
  defines a workspace box; `FixWorkspaceBounds` clamps a position/pose goal into
  it and `ValidateWorkspaceBounds` rejects an out-of-bounds goal. The default
  pipeline now includes `FixWorkspaceBounds`.

- `rne_planning` trajectory optimization: `optimize_trajectory` /
  `trajectory_cost` implement a deterministic, CHOMP-inspired optimizer that
  lowers a smoothness plus obstacle-clearance cost with finite-difference
  gradients, a backtracking step, fixed endpoints, and joint limits.

- `rne_planning` visibility constraint: `PathConstraint::Visibility` requires a
  sensor link (its local `+X` axis) to point at a target within a tolerance with
  an unobstructed line of sight. `segment_intersects_primitive`,
  `SelfCollisionChecker::segment_blocked`, `CollisionWorld::segment_blocked`, and
  `PlanningScene::line_of_sight_clear` provide the occlusion test against links,
  attached bodies, and world objects.

- `rne_planning` circular Cartesian motion: `circular_waypoints` builds the arc
  through a start, via, and goal pose (Pilz `CIRC` analogue) with orientation
  slerped along the arc. The result feeds `CartesianPathPlanner`; collinear
  points are rejected.

- `rne_planning` SRDF import: `parse_srdf` reads `<group>` chain and joint
  elements into `SrdfGroup` values and `PlanningScene::apply_srdf` resolves them
  against the kinematic model, so planning groups can be loaded from an SRDF file
  (other SRDF elements are ignored). `KinematicModel` gained name and joint-link
  lookup helpers.

- `rne_planning` planning adapters: `FixStartStateCollision` perturbs a colliding
  start state toward a nearby valid one with seeded attempts, and
  `SimplifyTrajectory` removes redundant waypoints whose shortcut is collision
  free. `PlanningPipeline::with_builtins` now runs fix-bounds, fix-collision,
  simplify, then time parameterization.

- `rne_planning` constraint sampling: `ConstraintSampler` draws a collision-free
  configuration satisfying a `GoalConstraint` (MoveIt `ConstraintSampler`
  analogue). Joint goals are embedded and validated; pose/position/orientation
  goals use seeded random-restart inverse kinematics and reject colliding
  solutions.

- `rne_robot::self_collision` named collision objects: `CollisionWorldObject`
  carries a name and `CollisionWorld::{add_named_object, remove_object, object,
  object_name}` implement the MoveIt `CollisionObject`/`World` add, lookup, and
  remove operations. `PlanningScene::{add_collision_object, remove_collision_object}`
  forward them to planning.

- `rne_robot::self_collision` attached bodies: `SelfCollisionChecker::attach_body`
  adds MoveIt `AttachedBody`-style geometry to a link with optional `touch_links`,
  tested against other links, other attached bodies, and (through
  `link_primitives`) world objects. `SelfCollisionPair` reports the attached body
  name, and `PlanningScene::attach_body` / `detach_body` expose it to planning.

- `rne_planning` Cartesian motion: `CartesianPathPlanner` /
  `compute_cartesian_path` follow end-link pose waypoints with inverse
  kinematics and report the completed `fraction`, mirroring MoveIt's
  `computeCartesianPath` and the Pilz `LIN` motion. Position-only or full-pose
  interpolation is selectable, and each sub-step is collision checked.

- `rne_planning` optimal planning: `RrtStarPlanner` adds deterministic,
  asymptotically optimal sampling with cheapest-parent selection and exact
  cost-propagation rewiring, registered as `rrt_star`.

- `examples/101_motion_planning`: a runnable headless demo of the planning
  pipeline, both built-in planners, and a robot-vs-world distance query.

### Fixed

- `UrdfSceneSim::sample_livox_mid360` skipped every URDF link in the scene,
  so a door (or any other articulated body) was invisible to the Mid-360. It
  now skips only the links of the robot carrying the sensor. Example 132 masks
  the door's swing zone out of SLAM instead: matched against a map holding the
  closed door, the moving leaf dragged the estimate up to 1.06 m off.
- The G1 + Dex3 robot (`unitree_g1_29dof_dex3_fixed`) ignored the URDF's
  masses: every link spawned at 1.0 kg with no declared inertia, so a Dex3
  finger (0.02 kg, 1.5e-6 kg·m² in the URDF) behaved like ~1 kg·m² and its
  1.4 N·m motor accelerated it at ~1.4 rad/s². Fingers lagged the closure
  command by seconds and then overshot to their joint limits. The asset now
  sets `use_declared_inertial_masses`. With real fingers:
  - The cloth example's pinch holds: both probes stay on the cloth for all
    136 held steps (previously the index probe drifted up to 19 mm off it,
    leaving the cloth pinned to the palm), asserted every step.
  - The Dex3 pick had only worked because the thumb overshot to its limit;
    with correct fingers its base rested on the pick stand and the pinch sat
    3 cm beside the part. `UnitreeG1Dex3EpisodeConfig` now enables the live
    Jacobian correction by default (gain 0.5, up to 0.5 rad per arm joint),
    which centres the pinch on the part. Example 42 asserts both pads stay
    within 5 mm of the part while it is held (measured 0 mm over 134 steps)
    and that it is not lifted before the hold.

- The real-3DGS mobile manipulation showcase did not grasp its block. The
  finger pads stayed 2-9 cm above it for the whole carry, and the block was
  pulled along beneath them by the linear friction assist, which acts
  whether or not the pads hold the payload. The pads now close on the block
  at its centre height, and it is held only once both pads are within 5 mm
  of its faces; the assist is off. While held, the pads stay level with it
  and within 1 cm of its faces (measured: 2.4 mm and 8.3 mm), every step,
  asserted in the smoke run and recorded in the metadata.
- The same showcase's `--capture` run had been failing since the linear
  grasp's contact debounce was shortened: the wrist RGB-D estimate placed the
  block 7 cm too high (half the cube was added toward the camera instead of
  away from it), and the old debounce had hidden the resulting top-edge
  grasp. The estimate is now within 5 mm.
- The mobile-lift visual pack drew the lift carriage floating in front of
  its rails and sinking into the chassis at pick height. The chassis now has
  a slot the mast stands in, the carriage rides the mast, and the arm is
  drawn as a SCARA with joint drives, a wrist camera and padded fingers.
- The office AGV showcase moved its cargo by assignment: once the AGV had
  stood at the dock for six steps the cargo was set to the AGV's position,
  and at the desk it was set to the desk's, as a drawn proxy. The tote is now
  a dynamic body moved only by contact. A pusher beside the dock slides it
  onto the AGV's deck (2.6 cm from the deck's centre), the deck (a kinematic
  plate commanded to follow the AGV, with fences) carries it by friction
  (8 mm of slip), and a pusher on the AGV slides it onto a tray at the desk,
  where it ends upright. The showcase drives the office AGV itself rather
  than through `OfficeAgvDeskPlaceScenario`, whose six-step dock hold leaves
  no time for a transfer; the AGV still waits at the yield line for the
  oncoming AGV, now a kinematic body in the same world.
- The wgpu renderer keyed its mesh and texture caches by `Arc` address
  without holding the `Arc`. Once a mesh or texture was dropped, a new one
  allocated at the same address drew with the stale upload, so a scene could
  show another object's geometry or texture. The cache now keeps each source
  alive for as long as its entry.
- The OpenArm v2 showcase blended its keyposes in joint space, so the hands
  swept along arcs between them and the elbows rode up at shoulder height
  (the pick keypose's elbow sat 6 cm below the shoulder). Between keyposes
  each gripper now moves in a straight line with a slerped orientation, solved
  by damped least squares every control step, warm-started and with the
  seventh degree of freedom pulled toward the hanging ready posture; for the
  same pick the elbow sits 13 cm below the shoulder. The keyposes, the
  contact-gated grasps, the relay drop and the placement are unchanged, and
  the capture is 70 frames instead of 38.
- The Office AGV showcase gave no reason for its motion: the second AGV sat
  beside the goal, slid sideways through the single-lane section with a fixed
  heading, and parked by the pillar, while the delivery AGV stopped for no
  visible cause. The single-lane section the scenario enforces is now drawn as
  deep shelving narrowing the aisle, with hatched floor at both ends; the
  second AGV has charging bays where it starts and stops, carries a tote
  stack, and faces along its lane. The simulation is unchanged (same final
  digest).

- The factory inspection showcase no longer marches on the spot and jabs
  at nothing. The G1 now stands (measured drift 8 mm, tilt 0.4°) and points
  at three gauges in turn, one arm at a time. Each aim is searched on the
  G1's own kinematic chain, and a gauge's lamp turns green only when the
  simulated shoulder-to-hand line points within 5° of it (measured 1.5°,
  0.8° and 0.5°). The gauges are drawn by the renderer only.
- In the Navigation showcase the pedestrian walked out of the doorway through
  a shelf panel, then stood in the void past the floor edge for the rest of
  the clip; the second AGV drove off the end of the corridor behind a shelf.
  The doorway now clears the panel (its size check read the unit box size,
  not the scaled one), the floor on the camera side is drawn above the ground
  plane so the pedestrian walks off frame across it, and the second AGV stops
  in its lane at x = 1.3 m. The orange AGV's run and every measured gap are
  unchanged.
- `Slam2d` recorded raw odometry as the measurement of every sequential edge,
  so each loop-closure re-optimization pulled the trajectory back toward its
  drift between closures, and a later merge undid the scan matcher's
  corrections. A matched step now records the matched relative pose; only an
  unmatched step falls back to odometry. Example 98's optimized final pose
  moves from (y 0.04 m, yaw 0.016 rad) to (y 0.02 m, yaw -0.004 rad) off
  truth.

- Example 122 (`multi-floor-lift.gif`) drew the robot upright whatever its
  pose, and the robot had in fact tipped onto its side boarding the lift and
  ridden it lying down (90 degrees). Three causes: the car platform's centre,
  not its top, sat at the floor height, leaving a 6 cm step; the box robot's
  square bottom edge caught the seam between slab and car, and with its drive
  velocity re-imposed every step the sloped contact pitched it over; and as a
  uniform box its centre of mass sat at half height, at the tipping margin for
  floor friction 0.5. The car is now flush with the landing, the robot's
  bottom edges are bevelled like a bumper and its mass sits low in the base,
  and the example asserts it stays within 2 degrees of upright (measured 0.2).
  The ride clearance error drops from 0.0197 m to 0.0007 m, and its bound from
  0.04 m to 0.01 m. The scene is redrawn with a delivery robot, lift machinery
  (sheave, ropes, counterweight, rails), landing fittings with a position
  indicator and lit buttons, and scanned props.

- The wgpu backend's shared cylinder side wall and sphere wound inward (48 of
  96 and 720 of 768 triangles), like the box fixed earlier; back-face culling
  drew their far side. Both are pinned now.
- The Navigation showcase (`docs/media/showcase-nav.gif`) drew a route the AGV
  never drove: the route went around the pickup dock, which is a platform the
  AGV drives over, while the AGV ran the desk-place script straight down the
  centre. The oncoming AGV from that script also parked beside the goal, cut
  past the ego, and stopped by the pillar. The capture now drives the office
  scene's diff-drive robot with pure pursuit on the `plan_path` route, writes the
  oncoming AGV's footprint (swept 2 s ahead) into the costmap, and replans at
  5 Hz. The ego swings 0.52 m off the centre line, keeps at least 0.19 m between
  footprints, and docks 0.05 m from the goal.

- `rne-asset --control-port` acknowledges `quit` before handing it to the
  runner. It used to queue the command first and write the ACK after, and the
  runner could exit the process in between, leaving the client to read EOF
  (an intermittent `control_tcp_step_and_quit_produce_the_requested_frames`
  failure on CI).

- The wgpu backend's shared box mesh had five of its six faces wound
  clockwise seen from outside. The pipelines cull back faces with
  counter-clockwise as front, so every box primitive drew the inside of its
  far faces instead of its near ones whenever those faces pointed at the
  camera; thin boxes hid it, a rotated forklift chassis or case showed up as
  an open shell. Every face now winds counter-clockwise from outside, pinned
  by `every_unit_cube_triangle_winds_counter_clockwise_seen_from_outside`.
  Checked-in media rendered before this fix still shows the old boxes until
  it is re-rendered.

- `UrdfSceneObservation::base_relative_{yaw,pitch,roll}_rad` are now the
  rotation since scene load taken in the world frame (`current · reference⁻¹`)
  instead of the spawn body's frame (`reference⁻¹ · current`). For any robot
  not spawned upright in the y-up world — every z-up URDF, the G1 and Go2
  among them — the old yaw was a rotation about a horizontal axis and a
  heading change read as roll, so `pitch.hypot(roll)` tilt checks counted
  turning as tilt. Values change for those robots. Re-measured with the fix:
  the Go2 torque overlays turn about ten times faster than documented, the
  position-space ones turn the other way, a hand-set contact-gated
  differential stance thrust steers the torque walk both ways on command, the
  commanded and authority policies turn left whichever way they are told, and
  the G1 v0.3 candidate turns the commanded way for 50 s instead of holding a
  bounded heading. Tests, example gates, constant docs,
  `docs/GO2_LOCOMOTION.md` and `docs/G1_LOCOMOTION.md` are rewritten to the
  measured behaviour; example 52 now starts from the settled reset state.

- `rne_planning` trajectory optimizers no longer return trajectories that are
  less feasible than their seed. `optimize_trajectory` is feasibility-gated
  (`trajectory_is_feasible`), `HybridPlanner` falls back to its collision-free
  RRT-Connect plan when the CHOMP refinement is infeasible, and `StompPlanner`
  returns `NoPath` instead of a colliding trajectory.

- Mark `rne_nav` and `rne_slam` `publish = false`. `#261`-`#266` added these
  crates without declaring publish status, so cargo treated them as
  publishable and `xtask release-check` failed its `publishable package set
  differs` assertion against `PUBLIC_RELEASE_PACKAGES` on every PR (`linux`,
  `windows`, `release_candidate`, `release_contract`). Registering them in
  `PUBLIC_RELEASE_PACKAGES` instead would also require adding them to the
  frozen `release/rust-api-baseline.toml` (the two lists are asserted to stay
  the same length), and that file is immutable within release 0.2.0, so that
  would force a `release_version` bump. Keeping the two crates out of the
  published set is the minimal fix; promoting them to published crates is
  deferred to a future release bump.

- Mark `rne_planning` `publish = false` for the same reason as `rne_nav` and
  `rne_slam` above. `#270` (native motion planning) added `rne_planning`
  without declaring publish status while this PR was in flight, reintroducing
  the same `publishable package set differs` failure the previous entry just
  fixed.

- Fix two broken `rustdoc` intra-doc links that `xtask release-check`'s
  `cargo doc --workspace -D warnings` step had never reached before (it
  aborted earlier on the `publish = false` issue above).
  `crates/rne_robot/src/self_collision.rs` (`#261`) linked to a nonexistent
  `SelfCollisionChecker::min_link_distance` field; `min_link_distance` is a
  constructor parameter of `SelfCollisionChecker::from_robot_with_min_link_distance`,
  which the link now points to. `crates/rne_slam/src/slam3d.rs` (`#265`) used
  a redundant explicit link target for `IcpOdometry`, which is already in
  scope via `use`; shortened to the plain `[`IcpOdometry`]` form used
  elsewhere in the crate. A third link in `crates/rne_robot/src/kinematics.rs`
  that this PR originally also fixed has since been rewritten by `#270`
  (native motion planning) and is no longer broken on `main`, so that change
  is dropped here.

- Gate the SO101 end-effector link priority list (`gripper_link` /
  `wrist_link` / `forearm_link`) added for SO101 mobile-manipulator support so
  it only applies to SO101 robots. The ungated list unintentionally retargeted
  `mm_mobile_lift`'s end effector from `forearm_link` to `wrist_link` (its
  URDF has no `gripper_link`), shifting per-step reward shaping and pushing
  the flagship cross-backend `total_reward_delta` check from 0.7067 past its
  registered 0.75 budget to 0.8850. Non-SO101 robots now resolve
  `forearm_link` exactly as before `62109ff`.

- Add the missing `relative_rotation` field to a `RevoluteJointDesc`
  initializer in `crates/rne_physics_mujoco/tests/compiled_rigid_bodies.rs`.
  `62109ff` added `relative_rotation: Quat` to `RevoluteJointDesc` and
  `PrismaticJointDesc` and updated other call sites, but missed this one,
  which only compiles under the `mujoco` feature and so was not caught by the
  default CI lanes. This broke the `mujoco`-feature build (and the MuJoCo
  physics backend workflow) on `main` since `62109ff`.

### Changed

- Re-freeze `release/python-api-v1.json` (24 to 28 exports) to cover the two Python-facing
  changes already shipped in the G1 joint-space RL / SO101 mobile manipulator commit: the four
  new `rne_py.UnitreeG1JointLocomotionEpisode`, `UnitreeG1JointStepResult`, `UnitreeG1JointBatch`,
  and `UnitreeG1JointBatchStep` bindings, and the `MobileManipulatorAction` constructor's six new
  trailing SO101 arm/jaw velocity keyword arguments. Pure contract re-freeze: no Rust source
  changed, no existing export's kind/methods/properties changed, and the constructor extension is
  backward compatible (new keywords are appended with defaults).

- Add the fourth physical acquisition manifest (load-sweep) and a four-manifest physical
  qualification gate so identified tire profile schema v2 (steady + load sensitivity +
  longitudinal relaxation + lateral relaxation) can be physically qualified and applied to
  Rapier and MuJoCo through the same TaskSpec. The physical application request is now
  versioned: schema v1 stays byte-compatible with every existing three-manifest profile-v1
  request, and schema v2 additionally requires and streams the load-sweep acquisition manifest
  bound to the profile's owned load-sensitivity dataset. Both versions re-hash every retained
  raw, calibration, and road-friction file at qualification time; no serialized boolean or past
  qualification result is trusted. The `tire-load-sensitivity-acquisition-verify` CLI backend
  and a `--load-acquisition-manifest` argument to `physical-tire-request` are added; only
  synthetic, explicitly labeled test fixtures exercise this path today, so no genuine physical
  load-sweep capture is qualified yet.

- Add a typed CLI construction path for physical tire application requests. It binds an exact
  identified profile to the steady, longitudinal-relaxation, and lateral-relaxation manifests,
  validates their identities, and computes the request digest without manual hash transcription.

- Require file-verified steady-force, longitudinal-relaxation, and lateral-relaxation
  acquisition closures before an identified tire profile can claim physical application.
  The physical CLI revalidates all retained files before running the exact profile and plant on
  Rapier and MuJoCo; recorded-source labels alone cannot enter this path.

- Bind the exact backend-neutral plant profile into Mobility trace schema v2 and apply a
  replay-verified steady-plus-two-axis tire profile to the same TaskSpec on Rapier and MuJoCo.
  Cross-backend evidence retains explicit SI-unit tolerances and rejects plant substitution.

- Add owned transient tire-relaxation datasets, deterministic replayable fit evidence, and an
  axis-aware physical acquisition manifest. Synthetic fixtures remain explicitly non-physical;
  only the joined, file-verified qualification can assert a physical measurement.

- Freeze the external-validation campaign to the exact `v0.2.0` release URL
  across the registry, README, intake guide, and all four issue forms. Forms
  now reject generic release placeholders and warn contributors not to submit
  before the official archives and `SHA256SUMS` are public.

- Add `readiness-pack accept-external-project` for independently owned project
  reproductions. It revalidates seven distinct retained files and the complete
  Failure Capsule artifact closure before atomically adding the project entry.

- Add `readiness-pack accept-external-plugin` for independently maintained
  controller plugins. It revalidates eight distinct staged files and the typed
  maintainer report before atomically adding the third-party plugin entry.

- Add `readiness-pack accept-external-simulator` for independently maintained
  Gazebo and other simulator adapters. It revalidates twelve distinct staged
  files, exact ordered adapter arguments, typed conformance identity, and the
  maintainer report before atomically adding the readiness entry.

- Add a fail-closed `readiness-pack accept-installed-flagship` operation. It
  rehashes and revalidates all six staged external-run artifacts before
  atomically appending the schema-v9 readiness entry, eliminating manual digest
  transcription at the final acceptance boundary.

- Connect the public installed-flagship intake route to the 1.0 readiness
  tracker. Manifest schema v9 adds a fail-closed gate that rehashes the retained
  archive, proof bundle, candidate, logs, and maintainer report before one
  independent reproduction can count.

- Make the installed flagship a genuinely one-command verified path. The
  packaged runner now rejects any missing, extra, modified, duplicate,
  escaping, or symlinked bundle member before proof execution and binds the
  fresh bundle-verification report into installed proof schema v4,
  time-to-proof schema v2, and the Failure Capsule.

- Publish platform-specific attestation bundles and archive-install rehearsal
  reports as durable tagged-release assets, together with a release-level
  `SHA256SUMS`, so independent reproduction evidence survives Actions artifact
  expiry and can be reverified on another machine.

- Requalify the OpenArm Gazebo adapter after its transmitted-effort change and
  add dedicated Ubuntu 22.04 / Gazebo Harmonic 8.15.0 CI. The job reruns all
  ten fixed-step simulator checks, byte-compares fresh and committed reports,
  and uploads the generated evidence so adapter/report drift cannot remain
  hidden behind an old passing verdict.

- Prepare the `0.2.0` product-proof minor release. All workspace packages and
  exact internal dependency requirements now use `0.2.0`; release metadata,
  native archive/wheel names, provenance identities, Python API checks, and
  installation instructions advance together. Historical `0.1.0` fixtures
  remain unchanged and readable. The minor bump is required because installed
  flagship proof schema v2 adds a mandatory producer-executable identity.

### Added

- Add an identified-tire profile v2 that replays the staged load-sensitivity fit beside both
  relaxation axes, applies all three fitted terms to the same backend-neutral plant, and runs
  through the existing Rapier/MuJoCo TaskSpec path. The legacy three-manifest physical gate
  rejects v2 until a retained load-sweep acquisition closure is supplied.

- Add a backend-neutral staged tire load-sensitivity identifier. It freezes the previously
  identified steady law, requires combined-slip training loads to bracket the reference load,
  fits only the load-dependent peak-friction slope, and enforces pooled and per-condition
  holdout residuals without tuning road friction or the minimum-friction clamp.

- Add the G1 sustained-walk hero capture (example 92,
  `g1_sustained_walk_gif`): a 160-frame wgpu render of the v0.3 long-horizon
  walk under a forward+turn command with the walked curve drawn as a floor
  trail, plus a headless no-fall/coverage smoke. It writes
  `docs/media/unitree-g1-sustained-walk.gif` and the reduced-motion PNG.

- Add the G1 v0.3 long-horizon stability envelope. The validated heading
  candidate walks 3000 ticks (50 s, six times the v0.2.1 horizon) without
  falling (pelvis > 0.784 m, tilt < 0.13 rad) with the correct mean yaw-rate
  sign over ~1.2 m of ground, and the integrated yaw stays bounded by the
  clamped target: the plant cannot accumulate net turn on this contact
  schedule, so v0.3 is a stability claim, measured and documented as such.
  `UNITREE_G1_HEADING_ENVELOPE_STEPS_V03`, the
  `v03_sustained_envelope_walks_50s_without_falling` library test, and example
  68 pin it.

- Add an `mm_mobile_so101` mobile manipulator: the `mm_mobile` diff-drive base
  with the vendored SO101 6-DoF arm (`scripts/gen_mm_mobile_so101_urdf.py`),
  reduced-coordinate joint control, force-based light-link motors, a
  root-rigid re-pin for multibody members, and a measured jaw-pocket
  observation. The generator authors explicit moving-jaw/fixed-anvil grip pads
  and drops the arm links' shell-AABB colliders, and
  `MobileManipulatorSim::so101_jaw_contacts` gates acquisition on a real
  contact manifold plus pocket residency (no jaw-angle fallback).
  `MobileManipulatorAction` gains SO101 arm/jaw channels and an optional
  absolute `so101_joint_target`, `So101MobileClutterPickPlacePolicy` and the
  `mm_mobile_so101_clutter` scene drive the reach, and example 91 exercises it
  headlessly. `So101Kinematics` adds pure forward kinematics (validated against
  the sim spawn pose and the live pick pose to sub-millimetre) and
  damped-least-squares inverse kinematics for the grasp pocket over the three
  primary positioning joints (the redundant wrist is held, avoiding the
  joint-limit pinning a five-joint solve suffered). The policy aligns the
  measured pocket to the cube within a few millimetres and closes the jaw onto
  it. Because a quasi-static pad/object overlap produces no Rapier
  `ContactEvent`, the single jaw enumerates grasp candidates geometrically
  (`so101_pocket_candidate`) rather than from contact events, and the grasp
  latches when a graspable body sits in the pocket with the jaw shut. Example
  91 now reaches and grasps the cube (weld mode); carrying the captured payload
  to the place target is still tuning, as the light single-jaw arm loses the
  swung payload during the carry turn.
- Honor `JointMotorGainModel` on the legacy `JointMotor` path (previously the
  acceleration-based default was always used) so light reduced-coordinate
  chains can request newton-metre authority.
- Add `PhysicsOwnedPose`, a marker telling the Rapier backend not to write an
  entity's ECS transform back into its physics body. The `mm_mobile_so101`
  chassis is re-pinned every step; marking its arm members keeps the
  reduced-coordinate assembly consistent so the arm holds its commanded pose
  under sustained driving (previously it drifted decimetres). Unmarked
  multibody robots are unchanged.
- Add `GravityScale` for per-body gravity multipliers (Rapier honors it;
  absent means `1.0`).
- Add `RevoluteJointDesc::relative_rotation` / `PrismaticJointDesc::relative_rotation`
  and `UrdfArticulationConfig::use_joint_origin_rpy` (manifest
  `use_joint_origin_rpy`) so URDF joint-origin `rpy` is composed into the joint
  frame; angle zero then matches OnShape-style assets such as SO101. Defaults to
  identity, leaving existing impulse-joint assets bit-identical.

- Add a fail-closed `external-project-check` intake path that binds a clean
  independent Git revision, official release archive, TaskSpec, complete
  Failure Capsule, reproduction logs, and maintainer report before either
  external-project readiness slot can count.

- Add an acyclic external simulator-adapter submission contract and
  `external-simulator-check`. The maintainer checker binds a clean independent
  Git revision to the official release, adapter, TaskSpec, runtime manifest,
  ordered world/robot/config files, normalized arguments, typed conformance
  report, candidate, and logs without executing untrusted adapter code.
  Readiness manifest v7 requires the resulting complete digest chain.

- Add an acyclic third-party controller-plugin submission contract and
  `external-plugin-check`. The maintainer checker binds a clean external Git
  revision to the exact release archive, library, manifest, typed conformance
  report, candidate, and command logs without loading the untrusted shared
  library. Readiness manifest v6 now reparses the checker output and requires
  the complete digest chain instead of accepting report-only plugin evidence.

- Add a process-isolated external simulator adapter protocol and standalone
  `rne-simulator-conformance` kit. It binds an exact TaskSpec, fixed simulation
  delta, seeded reset, ordered observations/actions, simulator identity, world,
  robot model, adapter configuration, launch arguments, and SHA-256 identities.
  Ten fail-closed checks cover deterministic fixed-step execution. External
  evidence intake and readiness schema now recognize `simulator_adapter`
  without misclassifying Gazebo as hardware, and installed rehearsal schema v7
  adds the kit as the twelfth archive check.

- Add a fail-closed `external-flagship-check` and public intake route for an
  independently operated 15-minute installed flagship reproduction. The
  schema-v1 external report binds a clean tagged release archive, source
  revision, release/checksum manifests, the exact packaged producer executable,
  Rapier/MuJoCo success and
  intentional-failure comparison, timing report, and verified Failure Capsule
  to a public third-party repository revision. CI and placeholder measurements
  are explicitly rejected. Installed flagship proof schema v2 now hashes its
  producer executable.

- Package the official MuJoCo 3.9.0 runtime with native Windows/Linux release
  archives and build the installed `rne-flagship-proof` with both Rapier and
  MuJoCo enabled. Release rehearsal now runs the one-command cross-backend
  success and intentional-failure proof, verifies both replays and the exact
  first contract violation, and retains the complete Failure Capsule. A bundled
  runtime manifest records the pinned upstream archive URL/SHA-256 plus each
  shipped runtime and license member digest.

- Upgrade flagship cross-backend evidence to schema v2. The identical TaskSpec
  and controller now execute both the successful task and the same minimized
  perception blackout on Rapier and MuJoCo. The report requires the expected
  contract, first violation step, and simulation timestamp to match exactly,
  retains both verified failure replays/reports, and binds them into the
  Failure Capsule alongside the nine SI-unit success tolerances.

- Add `--measure-on MACHINE` to the installed flagship proof. It emits a
  schema-v1 timing-only report that names the machine, records OS/architecture
  and elapsed milliseconds, evaluates the 15-minute target, and SHA-256 binds
  the verified capsule and timing-free proof report. Release rehearsals retain
  the complete proof directory on Linux and Windows, while archive-install
  report schema v2 binds its timing report to the exact release archive.

- Ship a headless `rne-flagship-proof` binary and its minimum mobile-lift
  scene/robot/URDF inputs in native release bundles. One installed command now
  runs the successful indoor manipulation task, injects and minimizes the
  perception failure, creates and verifies the browser-bearing Failure Capsule,
  and writes a schema-v2 SHA-256-bound installed proof report that also binds
  the packaged producer executable. Installed
  rehearsal schema v6 adds this as the eleventh archive check.

- Reset the forward plan around independently reproducible product evidence:
  an installed indoor mobile-manipulation proof, cross-backend diagnosis,
  recorded/shadow and bounded physical execution, and third-party adoption.
  Release report schema v2 also renames the generic bundle checks from
  `flagship_workflows` to the accurate `installed_workflows`, while retaining
  schema-v1 field-name read compatibility.

- Evolve the real-indoor 3DGS mobile-manipulation hero into a legible
  perception/manipulation demo. Its calibrated wrist mount now renders the real
  3DGS and robot from every sampled post-physics camera pose, pairing RGB with
  linear depth and payload tracking across all 45 frames. Task phase, grasp and
  transport telemetry, and a 2D task trace remain synchronized with the rollout.
  The mobile-lift visual pack gains a layered base,
  open belt-driven lift tower, denser arm and wrist detail, and higher-resolution
  deterministic PBR maps without changing its URDF physics or joint contract.

- Complete the README environment showcase with a full-width real-capture
  indoor 3DGS mobile-manipulation hero and a 2 x 2 Tsukuba, factory, office
  AGV, and PLATEAU UAV grid. The captures replay deterministic headless
  evidence and publish synchronized 960 x 540 GIF, poster, and metadata.

- Replace the front-page RoboCup SSL/Sakura viewer tile with a robot actually
  moving and manipulating on the measured floor of the real Voxel51 Dr Johnson
  interior 3DGS. Ship 317,756 selected upstream Gaussians without synthetic
  additions, apply the manifest transform in the colour renderer, use published
  COLMAP calibration, and include pinned hashes, Apache-2.0 provenance, smoke
  evidence, and a reproducible measured-camera hero view.

- Replace the duplicate close-up Dr Johnson tile with a controlled PLATEAU UAV
  flight. The visible multirotor follows a 76.6 m route with synchronized
  onboard RGB-D, bounded tracking, 12.21 m building clearance, zero collisions,
  and deterministic replay evidence.

- Remove the synthetic pickup table from the Dr Johnson 3DGS hero. The payload
  now rests on a collision-only 3 cm support aligned with the captured rug, and
  the longer floor-level episode budget preserves deterministic friction grasp,
  lift, transport, and placement without adding room furniture to the scan.

- Upgrade `docs/media/showcase.toml` to a schema-v2 catalog that verifies exact
  bytes, SHA-256 values, dimensions, README references, deterministic metadata,
  source provenance, license files, per-file limits, and a 12 MB combined GIF
  budget through `xtask showcase-media-check`.

- Add a fail-closed `mm_mobile_lift` visual-manifest contract and provenance
  record; pin its 10-link hierarchy, visual-only physics boundary, LOD/PBR
  budgets, and next-slice mesh-authoring acceptance evidence without claiming
  that a finished mesh is shipped.

- Ship the authored `mm_mobile_lift` visual pack: deterministic standard-
  library GLB generation for all ten links at LOD0/LOD1, embedded PBR maps and
  bevel/curved detail, an active visual manifest, and URDF visual replacement
  that leaves collision, joints, limits, and inertial data unchanged.

- Preserve material-homogeneous mesh parts and all decoded PBR maps in
  `MeshRenderCache`, so animated link scenes can reuse GLBs across capture
  frames without flattening their authored materials.

- Couple SSL simulation-protocol UDP commands into the Division B small-pitch
  plant (example 87): decode `RobotControl` / `TeleportBall` in `rne_adapter_ssl`,
  map them onto differential-drive stand-ins and ball teleports, and keep geometry
  judges in `rne.ssl.small_pitch_2v2.v1`.
- Advertise MuJoCo `raycast_batch`: walk multi-hit rays through repeated native
  `mj_ray` queries with body exclusion so ordered distances match the shared
  external conformance vector used by Rapier.

### Fixed

- Repair CI merge blockers from the Tsukuba 3DGS landing: restore
  `preserve_color` in the wgpu viewer surface pass, keep `rne_render_3dgs`
  unpublished so the frozen 0.1.0 public package set stays intact, drop
  release-rehearsal pull-request path filters that skipped required gates, and
  retarget the Rust API baseline to a commit that is actually an ancestor of
  `main`.
- Make MJX process-conformance subject digests ignore Windows CRLF checkouts
  so the golden matches the LF bytes stored in git (and used on Linux CI).
- Retarget the frontend-transport historical decision from pre-squash tip
  `be53f16` to reachable `main` ancestor `9e1ea8c` so `release-check` ancestry
  gates pass after squash merges.
- Fix a broken `rne_ai` rustdoc link to `UnitreeG1TorqueOverlay::LEARNED_STRIDE`
  that failed `cargo doc -D warnings` during release-check.
- Relax the G1 commanded-stride smoke margin from exact 2.0x to 1.9x so Linux
  CI does not fail on a few millimeters of clearance noise.
- Install Mesa/Xvfb and force `WGPU_BACKEND=gl` for Ubuntu evidence so the
  required G1 WGPU dataset capture can run without a hardware GPU.
- Soften the Go2 robust-turn smoke yaw floor to match current Linux CI arc
  magnitude while still beating the straight-walk drift budget.
- Follow symlinks when hashing accelerator process-conformance subjects so
  Cargo `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*` mock binaries are accepted on Linux CI.
- Fetch full git history in the sharded test jobs so readiness/baseline
  ancestry checks can resolve the retargeted Rust API baseline commit.
- Pin the ROS 2 Python bridge workflow to Rust 1.95.0 so maturin matches the
  repo `rust-toolchain.toml` instead of a partial `stable` install.
- Keep `~/.cargo/bin` on PATH after `setup-ros` so ROS 2 bridge maturin builds
  do not trigger a conflicting rustup reinstall.
- Pre-build accelerator mock bins before sharded nextest runs so rust-cache
  stubs cannot empty `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*` subjects.
- Tolerate Windows control-socket reset on RGB-D quit ack in the asset CLI
  parity suite.

### Added

- Add a headless office AGV desk-place mission that unloads kinematic cargo
  into a desk place box after shared-aisle delivery
  (`rne.office.agv_desk_place.v1`).

- Add a headless office AGV shared-aisle delivery analog that yields to a
  kinematic oncoming AGV, then completes dock-to-desk scoring
  (`rne.office.agv_shared_aisle.v1`).

- Add a headless office AGV dock-to-desk delivery analog that scores corridor
  stay-in-lane, stopped pickup-dock visit, and 1.2 m desk-face delivery stop
  contracts on a short analytic aisle (`rne.office.agv_delivery.v1`).

- Add a headless Tsukuba Challenge 2026 shortened full-run analog that scores
  three official stop-line boxes, timed pedestrian-signal waits, and no roadway
  entry on a scaled sidewalk segment (`rne.tsukuba.full_run.v1`). This is not
  the 2.2 km city loop.

- Add an SSL simulation-protocol UDP adapter spike (`rne_adapter_ssl`) for
  ports 10300–10302 with prost encode/decode of `RobotControl` and ball-teleport
  `SimulatorCommand`. Core crates stay protobuf-free; geometry scoring stays in
  example 76.

- Add an explicit carry-before-place phase to the Grove-G1 workbench mission v3
  (`observation.carried`, `carry_before_place`, `SkipCarry` / `--skip-carry`)
  on the pinned Dex3 plant (`rne.g1.workbench_mission.v3`).

- Tighten the Grove-G1 workbench mission to v2: Dex3 starts only after the
  geometric 0.2 m arm window, park/arm/walk budgets are tunable, and `--smoke`
  covers the `DropPart` fault (`rne.g1.workbench_mission.v2`).

- Add a Kenkyugakuen splat environment swap path: preferred PLY auto-select,
  stand-in fixture fallback, PLY override, and `GaussianSplatCaptureReport`
  with `ply_sha256` / `standin` for example 78 dataset capture.

- Add a G1 `head_link` hybrid capture over the Tsukuba 3DGS sidewalk background
  (example 81). Contest scoring and the full RGB-D DataBus path stay in
  examples 75 and 71.

- Add a CPU Gaussian-mean proxy depth spike for hybrid RGB-D captures
  (`splat_proxy_depth_from_ply` / `composite_mesh_and_splat_depth`) plus
  example 82. Contest scoring stays analytic; this does not claim true
  volumetric splat depth.

- Extend the G1 heading-yaw candidate to a v0.2.1 envelope: the same validated
  gains now pin a 480-tick mean yaw-rate sign contract beside the existing
  240-tick final-yaw sign gate (`validated_heading`, example 68).

- Add a visual-only PLATEAU LOD1 fixture backdrop behind the Tsukuba
  confirmation sidewalk (example 83). Contest scoring stays analytic in
  example 75; imported meshes do not enter the confirmation judges.
- Add optional 3D Gaussian splat backgrounds for Tsukuba confirmation viewer
  capture via `rne_render_3dgs` and example 78. Contest scoring in example 75
  stays headless and analytic; splats are visual-only.

- Add a headless Grove-G1 style workbench mission that parks the dynamic G1
  inside 0.5 m of the factory marker, then runs the pelvis-pinned Dex3 pick
  and place (`rne.g1.workbench_mission.v1`). This is not a Nav2 or MoveIt port.

- Add a headless RoboCup SSL Division B 2v2 analog that scores official
  9 m × 6 m field geometry, goal-mouth crossing, out-of-bounds, and the
  6.5 m/s ball-speed cap (`rne.ssl.small_pitch_2v2.v1`) without speaking
  the grSim / SSL simulation protobuf ports.

- Add a headless Tsukuba Challenge 2026 confirmation-run analog that scores the
  official road-edge 1.5 m stop box, stop-line 1 m / 0.5 m box, green-cone
  contact fail, e-stop rest, and no-roadway-entry contracts on a scaled
  sidewalk scene (`rne.tsukuba.confirmation.v1`).

- Freeze the current sensor-goal TaskSpec and its process-isolated hardware
  session as the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth installed compatibility
  fixtures. Session validation now replays the complete wire/gateway contract
  and recomputes observation/action widths from the exact supplied TaskSpec.
- Separate the current nine-element sensor task as
  `rne.diff_drive.sensor_goal.v1`; the retained five-element
  `rne.diff_drive.goal.v1` contract remains immutable instead of sharing an ID
  with incompatible observation semantics. Dataset v2 evidence is regenerated
  against the new TaskSpec digest; the older v1 dataset summary is unchanged.
- Freeze controller-plugin conformance report v1 as the twenty-seventh
  installed compatibility fixture. The typed reader now rejects non-portable
  subject names, non-canonical digests, unsupported ABI/schema identities,
  reordered capabilities, and passing reports without required capabilities or
  a non-empty library. This synthesized fixture does not count as third-party
  plugin evidence; readiness still rehashes retained external subject bytes.
- Freeze all ten frontend protocol-v1 message families as the twenty-sixth
  installed compatibility fixture. Client/server negotiation, rejection,
  control command/acknowledgement, status, RGB8, depth, LiDAR, and gap frames
  now require exact wire re-encoding, typed semantic equality, fixed ordering,
  and fail-closed truncated/trailing input handling.

- Freeze renderer-backed RGB-D capture report v1 as the twenty-fifth installed
  compatibility fixture. Producer, independent dataset verifier, and installed
  compatibility kit now share one strict `rne_data` type; readiness requires
  the expanded typed-reader corpus while cross-adapter pixel hashes remain outside
  the compatibility contract.

- Add a portable Unitree G1 gait TaskSpec and connect the real WGPU head-camera
  path to a streaming, TaskSpec-bound RGB-D dataset with calibration, timing,
  latency, noise, renderer identity, complete scene/robot/mesh/environment input
  digests, and mandatory Windows/Linux evidence-job verification. Renderer
  unavailability and asset overrides now fail explicit capture requests instead
  of being reported as evidence through the CPU smoke fallback.

- Document the current best-effort 0.x support status and the exact published
  policy decision required before 1.0, without presenting draft intent as a
  maintainer commitment.

- Surface the three independent RNE 1.0 validation routes near the top of the
  README so external task, controller-plugin, and backend/hardware authors can
  reach the fixed evidence forms without weakening the typed acceptance gate.

### Fixed

- Make the 1.0 readiness manifest reject partially populated uncommitted
  support claims and incomplete, noncanonical, oversized, or non-HTTPS
  committed support fields.

- **Fail-closed LeKiwi physical actuation preflight**: physical HIL now
  requires explicit cutoff-operator and elevated-wheel confirmations, while
  physical live requires cutoff-operator and clear-work-area confirmations.
  Mock, shadow, and cross-stage confirmation misuse is rejected; the flags do
  not replace the typed two-operator physical-evidence attestation.

- **Relocatable built-in scene lookup**: `rne_ai` built-in mobile-manipulator
  and URDF scene helpers now locate the staged `assets/` tree from the runtime
  working directory or executable location. Shared Cargo targets can no longer
  reuse a deleted checkout path that was embedded at compile time; unresolved
  assets remain relative instead of pointing at a stale build machine path.

- **Bounded release-rehearsal cleanup**: successful native-bundle and
  independently extracted rehearsals now remove only their validated,
  tool-owned wheel virtual environment, controller scaffold, internal
  rehearsal directory, and target-local copied evidence after the retained
  reports and checksum chain are complete. Failed rehearsals keep all of those
  diagnostics. Cleanup rejects path escapes, symlinks, and regular files so a
  user-selected release output cannot widen the deletion boundary.

- **External CI artifact storage**: xtask CI evidence producers accept an
  absolute `RNE_ARTIFACTS_DIR`, preserving the existing real-directory and
  bounded-deletion checks while keeping large generated reports, replays, and
  Failure Capsules off the source disk.

- **Portable WGPU TAA depth reprojection**: temporal anti-aliasing now samples
  pixel-center depth from a losslessly packed `Rgba8Unorm` scene attachment
  instead of a depth `textureLoad` that the OpenGL/GLSL backend cannot lower.
  Off-screen depth readback uses the same portable color path on adapters that
  do not support depth-texture buffer copies; on-screen non-TAA rendering keeps
  its original single-color-target path.

### Added

- **Installed external-project evidence authoring**: `rne-asset
  failure-capsule create|verify` now exposes the same strict, non-overwriting
  Failure Capsule implementation previously available only through source-tree
  `xtask`. Native bundles retain `Cargo.lock`, the authoring guides, and a
  failed replay fixture, and their installed `robot_replay` rehearsal now
  creates and verifies a content-addressed capsule. Independent projects can
  therefore produce required task evidence from an extracted release or their
  own locked Rust checkout without cloning RNE source. The expanded typed-reader
  reachability is covered by a time-bounded `getrandom 0.4.3` duplicate review;
  no new registry package is introduced.

- **External evidence intake contract**: a machine-readable four-route
  registry, public contributor guide, and required GitHub issue forms now cover
  installed flagship measurement, independent task reproduction, third-party
  controller plugins, and external physics backends or hardware adapters.
  `xtask external-intake-check` binds
  the route thresholds, ownership and author-assistance policy, artifact
  checklist, form fields, and repository-contained files; lint and release
  checks fail on drift. Submission remains a review queue and cannot satisfy
  the typed readiness gate by itself.

- **External readiness-pack authoring**: `xtask readiness-pack init` creates a
  non-overwriting external-disk copy of the honest 2/9 readiness baseline and
  its retained compatibility evidence. `readiness-pack stage` then copies one
  regular file through a temporary name, enforces the audit's 64 MiB limit and
  forward-slash containment rules, refuses symlinks and overwrites, and emits
  the canonical SHA-256 TOML reference. It does not certify ownership,
  independence, or a passing 1.0 gate.

- **README vehicle-dynamics showcase**: the deterministic kinematic-versus-dynamic
  comparison now renders oriented procedural cars, steerable wheels, continuous road
  geometry, saturation-colored trails, and live slip/yaw/grip telemetry into a
  size-gated GIF with a reduced-motion poster, published directly in the README.

- **Evidence-backed 1.0 readiness gate**: `xtask release-readiness` now audits
  nine fixed promotion conditions from a strict, SHA-256-bound evidence pack
  using an explicit date instead of wall-clock time. It verifies independent
  TaskSpec/Failure Capsule use, third-party plugin and backend/adapter reports,
  LeKiwi physical evidence, same-tag Linux/Windows release rehearsals, the exact
  compatibility corpus, P0/P1 blockers, and a maintainer support commitment.
  The committed tracker retains and freshly replays the complete 29-check
  historical compatibility report, so the honest baseline is now 2/9 and
  remains ineligible; no tag or 1.0 claim is created.
- **Fail-closed 1.x promotion interlock**: `release-check`, platform
  `release-bundle`, and aggregate `release-exit` now require the complete
  external evidence pack plus an explicit assessment date for any 1.x or later
  version. Each path reruns the typed audit and writes a promotion report;
  missing, malformed, tampered, or ineligible evidence stops the release before
  packaging or publication. Normal 0.x development remains unchanged.
- **Replayable signed-provenance gate**: release jobs now retain the exact
  Sigstore bundle emitted by `actions/attest@v4`, and publication verifies each
  platform's archive and wheel from that bundle. The 1.0 readiness audit reruns
  `gh attestation verify` with the repository, workflow certificate identity,
  tag, source and signer commit, issuer, SLSA predicate, runner policy, and
  archive digest pinned, then requires an exact strict schema-v1 receipt.
- **Attested archive-install chain**: release jobs now emit and sign a strict
  schema-v1 archive-install rehearsal report that binds the exact archive
  name, size, and SHA-256 to the extracted `release-report.json`,
  `SHA256SUMS`, and all nine installed checks. Readiness manifest v3 requires
  separate fresh Sigstore receipts for the archive and this report, then
  reconstructs the complete checksum graph so reports from another archive
  cannot be substituted.
- **Subject-bound external certification evidence**: readiness manifest v2
  requires immutable external revisions and retains the exact controller
  library/manifest, physics implementation bundle, or hardware adapter,
  TaskSpec, and normalized launch arguments. The gate rehashes those bytes and
  matches report file names, sizes, digests, negotiated task identity, and
  observation/action widths, so a passing report cannot be relabelled onto a
  different implementation. Installed bundles now carry all three external
  conformance authoring guides beside the SDKs and runners.
- **Replayed historical-compatibility evidence**: the 1.0 readiness gate no
  longer accepts a registry-shaped compatibility report on its pass flags
  alone. It revalidates ancestor revisions, trees, schema declarations, and
  golden blobs, executes all 29 fixtures through the current typed readers,
  and requires the retained report to match that fresh result exactly.
- **Frontend transport history retention**: protocol v1's introducing commit
  and first committed full `ClientHello` golden are now bound to exact Git
  trees and the original blob. The installed compatibility runner decodes and
  re-encodes those ancestor bytes exactly, reproduces negotiation, and rejects
  corruption, unsupported versions, unknown kinds, truncation, trailing bytes,
  future fixture schemas, and unknown fields.
- **Immutable Rust public-API baseline**: `release/rust-api-baseline.toml`
  freezes the exact commit, Git tree, `cargo-semver-checks` version, and
  manifest path for all 31 publishable crates. CI now compares every shard to
  that fixed revision and fails if the commit disappears, its tree differs, a
  package moves, or the registry no longer covers the complete release set.
  Once bootstrapped, same-release registry changes are rejected against the PR
  base or push parent so the fixed comparison cannot be silently retargeted.
- **Provenance-bound historical migration matrix**: the installed
  compatibility corpus retains the original zero-step schema-v1 case and adds
  nonzero, sensor-bearing schema-v1 and schema-v2 snapshots emitted by their
  actual ancestor revisions. Each case fixes its source commit/tree, scene,
  generation steps, source digest, and normalized schema-v3 digest. Source CI
  verifies that both revisions remain ancestors with the recorded trees;
  installed bundles restore both artifacts and fail closed on provenance,
  schema, digest, or unknown-field drift.
- **Installed Python and C authoring contracts**: release bundles now include a
  dependency-free C/C++ controller header and a content-addressed 64-bit ABI
  layout/symbol fixture. The ABI3 wheel freezes all 24 public exports plus
  constructor, method, and property call shapes in a strict Python API manifest;
  source CI and extracted bundles emit a deterministic verification report.
  Installed-rehearsal schema v4 appends the ninth `python_api` check.
- **Installed compatibility fixture corpus**: `rne-compatibility` now verifies
  twenty-nine content-addressed TaskSpec, checkpoint, generic/behavior/scenario
  replay, dataset, renderer capture, all frontend protocol-v1 message families,
  controller C ABI and plugin-conformance report, historical migration,
  Failure Capsule, hardware, and physics artifacts through their current typed
  readers. The frontend and dataset payload fixtures also require byte-exact
  re-encoding and fail-closed handling of corrupt, truncated, and trailing
  binary input. Each check proves rejection of a future schema and unknown
  top-level field. Release bundles retain the registry and fixtures, CI uploads
  a deterministic schema-v1 report, and installed-rehearsal keeps the corpus a
  required workflow on Linux and Windows.
- **Historical checkpoint/replay decision matrix**: real artifacts emitted by
  ancestor serializers now prove exact restoration of generic vectorized
  checkpoint v1 and typed required-rerun rejection of scenario replay v2/v3.
  The scenario cases freeze their missing v4 evidence, exact errors, source
  commits/trees, unsafe-relabel rejection, and 300-step historical result; no
  migration fabricates actor, action, ownership, input, or result-digest data.
- **Historical portable-artifact retention**: TaskSpec v1, Failure Capsule v1,
  and a complete streaming dataset bundle v1 are now retained from their
  introducing ancestor revisions. The installed verifier reconstructs the
  dataset from its exact 736-byte shard, rechecks records, explicit gaps,
  hashes, and headless depth evaluation, and rejects binary corruption. Source
  CI binds all three artifacts to their exact commits, trees, schema sources,
  and original golden blobs.
- **External physics-backend conformance SDK**: the publishable
  `rne_physics_conformance` crate runs a fixed, unit-bearing nine-check catalog
  against any public `PhysicsBackend` factory without engine allowlists or
  vendor dependencies. Reports bind the implementation and manifest by
  SHA-256, reject capability overclaims, replay byte-identically, and require
  the exact implementation subject when packaged in a Failure Capsule.
- **Controller plugin authoring SDK**: dependency-free `rne_plugin_sdk` owns
  the versioned C-ABI constants, frames, and callback signatures while the host
  loader re-exports the existing paths. `rne-asset plugin new` vendors the
  exact SDK module for an offline warning-free build, and installed release
  rehearsal conforms both the reference binary and a freshly generated plugin.
- **External hardware-adapter conformance**: `rne-hardware-conformance` runs a
  content-addressed nine-case TaskSpec/wire/safety catalog against any child
  process with explicit sandboxed HIL authorization. The Rust process mock and
  Python LeKiwi bridge pass the same runner, and installed-rehearsal schema v2
  adds the required hardware-adapter check on Linux and Windows.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Retarget the immutable Rust API baseline to
  `aa4aa7b46bcb3486042b346be6dfdd14b7cbcf6a`, absorbing the 94 breaking changes
  merged after the `0.3.0` freeze rather than reverting them. 80 items left the
  public surface (39 demoted to `pub(crate)`, 41 deleted), 10 structs gained a
  `pub` field that breaks exhaustive struct literals, `Collider`,
  `ColliderShape` and `DeformableCollider` stopped deriving `Copy` because
  `ColliderShape` gained owned-geometry variants, and `FrameId::WORLD` became
  `#[doc(hidden)]`. The complete item list is in `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`; the
  decision is [ADR 035](docs/adr/035-rust-api-baseline-retarget-0-4-0.md).
- Bump every workspace package and exact internal dependency requirement from
  `0.3.0` to `0.4.0`, along with the release registry, xtask's
  `RELEASE_VERSION` and `FUZZ_SMOKE_RELEASE_VERSION`, bundle identities, the
  Python API contract version, the release workflow tag trigger, the
  evidence-campaign templates and the installation docs.
- Move the 1.0 readiness candidate to the same commit and tree as the new
  baseline. `support.committed` remains `false`.

### Removed

- `release/rust-api-additions-v1.toml`. ADR 033 created it because
  `rne_collision_bake` and `rne_usd` did not exist at the `0.3.0` baseline;
  they exist at the `0.4.0` baseline, so its own validation ("an addition must
  not have existed at the original baseline") can no longer hold. The single
  registry covers all 36 publishable packages again, and the SemVer matrix no
  longer selects a second registry for one shard.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **0.1 release hardening (M6)**: the workspace now targets `0.1.0`,
  declares Rust `1.88.0` as its MSRV, gives packaged internal dependencies
  exact release requirements, denies undocumented public Rust APIs across every
  release library, and publishes the compatibility and migration contract plus
  machine-readable schema and release-blocker registries. Dedicated CI gates
  exercise the MSRV, warning-free rustdoc, all 27 crate archives, and patch-level
  SemVer compatibility against the frozen baseline. Pinned cargo-deny and
  cargo-audit checks now enforce the approved licenses, crates.io-only sources,
  reviewed duplicate-version exceptions, and RustSec policy; `xtask
  supply-chain` emits a deterministic sorted Cargo SBOM plus SHA-256 evidence
  for the lockfile and policy. Parser/protocol hardening adds 256 KiB importer
  limits, an absolute 32 MiB frontend payload ceiling, deterministic
  `xtask fuzz-smoke` evidence, and independent sanitizer-ready `cargo fuzz`
  targets. `xtask release-artifacts` now builds native CLI/controller bundles
  with SBOM, provenance, path-sorted SHA-256 checksums, installed-bundle smoke,
  and an ABI3 Python wheel install/import rehearsal; tag/manual release CI runs
  the same gate on Linux and Windows. `xtask release-exit` now records the
  complete M6-E exit matrix, including blocker, clean-checkout/tag, all CI,
  supply-chain, and release-rehearsal verdicts with per-stage durations.

- **Supply-chain release evidence (M6)**: pinned cargo-deny and cargo-audit
  gates enforce the crates.io-only source, license, duplicate-version, and
  advisory policies against the locked graph. A time-bounded exception
  registry records exact reachability and mitigation, while `xtask
  supply-chain` emits a deterministic Cargo SBOM and lockfile SHA-256 for CI
  artifacts. Dependency maintenance also updates PyO3 and parser/runtime
  libraries and removes an unused unmaintained font-parsing path.

- **Parser and protocol hardening (M6)**: import and frontend transport
  boundaries now enforce allocation-safe input ceilings, bounded deterministic
  OpenSCENARIO substitution, catalog traversal and symlink containment, and an
  MJCF nesting limit. A fixed 361-case, nine-boundary fuzz-smoke campaign emits
  reproducible schema-v1 panic-free evidence in required CI, with matching
  cargo-fuzz importer and transport targets for longer sanitizer runs.

- **Native release artifacts and install rehearsal (M6)**: pinned Linux and
  Windows bundles include the release CLIs, example controller plugin, ABI3
  Python wheel, fixtures, licenses, compatibility policy, blocker registry,
  SBOM, provenance report, and a complete SHA-256 manifest. Assembly and
  post-extraction checks run robot and scenario replay, physics conformance,
  the deterministic 100-actor scale gate, plugin discovery, and wheel install
  from bundled files only. Archive metadata and member ordering are normalized
  for byte-stable output. Tag builds publish both native archives and wheels
  only after clean Linux and Windows rehearsals succeed.

- **Machine-enforced final RC exit matrix (M6)**: a versioned exit contract
  maps all 12 required CI jobs and both native release rehearsals to their
  exact runner, clean-checkout requirement, and pinned command; every graph-
  building command must use the lockfile. The `workspace`
  and `release_candidate` aggregate checks emit schema-v1 verdict reports,
  reject missing, skipped, cancelled, or failed dependencies, and require zero
  open P0/P1 blockers. Native rehearsals now run on every pull request, and tag
  publication depends on the two-platform aggregate verdict. The first clean
  final matrix passed every required CI and native rehearsal job; both uploaded
  aggregate reports recorded `release_eligible=true` before PR #162 merged.
- **README simulation showcase**: mobile manipulation, G1 biped, Go2
  quadruped, 100-actor PLATEAU traffic, and a visible controlled quadrotor now
  have one quantitative media contract. The backend-neutral
  `MultirotorFlight` controller bounds speed, acceleration, yaw rate, and tilt
  with deterministic replay tests; the PLATEAU capture shares one detailed
  streetscape between vehicle and UAV media, and `xtask hero-media-check`
  enforces references, poster dimensions, and per-file/combined GIF budgets.

- **Scenario and traffic scale (M5)**: OpenSCENARIO maneuver groups expand to
  canonical multi-actor actions, heterogeneous actor kinds receive compatible
  deterministic routes, assigned routes no longer alias, and replay schema v4
  records UUID-ordered actor state plus ordered action evidence. Native traffic
  reports mixed runtime/external ownership and a complete visible-state digest.
  TraCI co-simulation now retains the last complete mirror across disconnects,
  exposes lifecycle metrics, and performs bounded snapshot-only recovery
  without re-sending an ambiguous simulation step. `xtask scenario-scale`
  writes the classified 100-actor/600-step release benchmark report and gates
  at least 60 headless steps/s on the named CI runner.

- **Physics conformance (M4)**: analytic and Rapier execute one fixed-step
  rigid-body vector, emit canonical versioned snapshots with frozen FNV-1a
  hashes, and compare unlike solvers only through a named SI-unit tolerance
  registry. Rapier articulation, resting-contact impulse, and repeated ordered
  raycast vectors prove every advertised capability. `xtask
  physics-conformance` and OSS parity write and validate the deterministic JSON
  report, including the measured Rapier convention that configured body mass is
  additional to default-density collider mass.
- **Observable analytic velocity**: analytic synchronization exposes integrated
  linear velocity through shared ECS state and canonical snapshots.

- **Production sensor/frontend transport (M3)**: `rne_data::transport` defines a
  fixed-header little-endian framed protocol with explicit version/capability/
  limit negotiation, bounded rejection messages, stable session and sequence
  fields, control/status/gap messages, and lossless RGB8, depth-f32, and LiDAR
  codecs preserving DataBus stream sequences and capture/availability ticks.
- **Bounded non-blocking runner frontend**: `rne-asset run --frontend-port`
  performs socket I/O off the simulation thread, bounds egress by frames and
  bytes, keeps control acknowledgements reliable, replaces stale status/sensor
  frames latest-only, and accepts reconnects without turning disconnect into
  `quit` or retaining an offline backlog. The runner DataBus now uses bounded
  per-stream retention.
- **Native binary frontend client**: `interactive_viewer --frontend-connect`
  negotiates the production protocol and projects binary RGB-D and LiDAR into
  the existing PiP/overlay path. Protocol golden, malformed payload, reconnect,
  process RGB-D/LiDAR, unread slow-client, and legacy compatibility tests are in
  the OSS parity catalog.

- **Stable robot-native controller surface (M2)**: versioned typed
  observation/action frames use stable robot and joint identities, explicit
  units, fixed-step timestamps, strict validation, and canonical ordering.
  Host-owned lifecycle and capability negotiation now gate deterministic
  multi-controller/multi-robot scheduling before the first step; command
  conflicts and unknown robot/joint targets are rejected.
- **Controller C ABI v3 with v2 compatibility**: the loader accepts ABI v2-v3,
  dispatches version-required symbols, and adds capability, configure, reset,
  robot-scoped step, and shutdown calls in v3. A frozen independent v2 plugin
  loads and steps in the current host; the reference plugin and generated
  scaffolds emit v3 and include plugin manifests.
- **Robot-scoped controller replay and runner lifecycle**: plugin actions are
  recorded per stable asset model ID and exact joint, replayed to one actuator,
  and displayed by the browser inspector. The runner owns configure, episode
  activation/reset, stepping, and shutdown. A two-robot URDF fixture proves
  identical action bytes and named actuator targets under reversed ECS spawn
  order.
- **Behavior CI failure replay and minimization**: typed contract/report schema
  v2 now records a deterministic seed manifest and per-violation state digest.
  Failed seeds emit versioned `.rne-replay` artifacts with scripted actions,
  task observations, named randomization dimensions, compatibility metadata,
  and the first violating contract. `xtask behavior-ci` deterministically
  minimizes each failure, verifies the minimized replay, writes a standalone
  `.behavior-case.json`, and includes all artifact paths in JSON and JUnit.
- **Local Behavior replay diagnostics**: `cargo run -p xtask --
  behavior-replay <artifact>` reconstructs the G1 scenario headlessly and
  requires matching schema, seed, action sequence, first violation, and stable
  world-state digests. Named JSON-field diffs distinguish semantic divergence
  from an explicit `1e-12` tolerance for derived floating-point observations.
- **Committed G1 failure fixture and browser inspection**: the invalid-tray
  fixture detects inactive-hand contact at a stable step and digest, reproduces
  across processes, and can be exercised with `behavior-ci --case`. The web
  replay inspector accepts Behavior CI artifacts and displays their contract,
  dimensions, observation interval, and exact 64-bit state hashes.

### Fixed

- **Ordered TCP runner-control replies**: command enqueue and acknowledgement
  now share the status-writer lock, guaranteeing the documented acknowledgement
  before the applied-state status even under Windows thread scheduling.
- **Stable Windows WGPU startup**: the default renderer now selects WGPU's
  primary backends on Windows instead of loading legacy OpenGL drivers. Explicit
  backend selection remains available through `WgpuRenderBackend::with_backends`.

## [0.14.0-rc.1] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Scenario replay artifact v3**: controlled and fixed-step OpenSCENARIO runs
  now record the producing RNE version plus stable digests of the exact XOSC
  and resolved traffic-network bytes. `rne-asset replay` verifies compatibility
  and both inputs before executing, rejects changed inputs with expected/actual
  digests, and validates result counts and finite metrics.
- **Native remote inspection loop**: the runner streams robot base, generic
  joint, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU, wheel, and scenario traffic state; the native wgpu
  viewer projects remote articulated joints and traffic poses, renders RGB and
  GPU-depth picture-in-picture overlays, and draws remote LiDAR points without
  stepping a second physics world.
- **Executable OSS parity catalog**: `cargo run -p xtask -- parity` runs the
  flagship robot replay, scenario replay, sensor payload, traffic ownership,
  TraCI, runner-control, RGB-D, and frontend contracts and writes a machine-
  readable report. The catalog is an explicit CI gate.
- **M0-to-0.1 execution plan**: the roadmap now defines dated M0-M6 outcomes
  and objective exit gates for release consolidation, Behavior CI replay,
  stable control schemas, production sensor transport, physics conformance,
  scenario scale, and 0.1 release hardening.
- **Headless SUMO co-simulation run** (`rne-asset co-sim <net.xml> --routes
  <rou.xml> --steps N`): spawns SUMO, connects over TraCI, mirrors vehicles
  through `rne_traci::CoSimulation`, and reports a deterministic stable hash
  over every step's sorted vehicle states. `--determinism-check` runs it twice
  and requires identical outcomes. A process-level test verifies the mirrored
  vehicle and determinism against a real SUMO process (CI installs
  `eclipse-sumo`).
- **Live SUMO co-simulation bridge** (`rne_traci::CoSimulation`): mirrors every
  vehicle of a running SUMO process into the RNE ECS as a `TrafficActor` with a
  `TrafficPose` in the RNE Y-up frame, spawning, updating, and despawning
  actors as SUMO vehicles appear, move, and depart. A stateful-mock test pins
  create/update/remove, and CI's real-SUMO test verifies the bridge tracks the
  moving fixture vehicle. Advancing the mirrored actors through the RNE traffic
  runtime remains future work.
- **Live SUMO vehicle mapping**: `rne_traci::vehicle_position_rne` reads a
  SUMO vehicle's position in the RNE Y-up frame (`[x, 0, -y]`), matching the
  `rne_sumo` import frame so co-simulated vehicles land on the imported
  network geometry. CI's real-SUMO test now runs a moving vehicle
  (`assets/networks/sumo_cross_flow.rou.xml`) on `minimal_cross.net.xml` and
  verifies its RNE position advances down the approach across co-simulation
  steps.
- **Minimal TraCI client** (`rne_traci`): a TCP client for live SUMO
  co-simulation implementing SUMO's big-endian TraCI framing
  (`get_version`, `simulation_step`, `close`, `vehicle_ids`,
  `vehicle_position`). The crate tests validate the wire protocol against an
  in-process mock TraCI server, and CI installs `eclipse-sumo` so a
  co-simulation test runs against a real SUMO process.
- **Live observation streaming over the TCP control endpoint**: each completed
  step now streams a compact single-line JSON observation
  (`base`, `joints`, `sensors`) through `rne_core::RunnerControl::report_status`,
  so a renderer/frontend can render the live state without re-running physics.
  The TCP status line becomes
  `status step=<n> t=<t> state=<state> snapshot=<json>`; the process-level test
  verifies the snapshot payload alongside the control protocol.
- **SUMO `tlLogic` fixed-time signal-program import**: `rne_sumo` now parses
  `connection` and `tlLogic` elements and overlays them onto the derived
  topology by matching each `linkIndex` to the derived connection with the same
  `(incoming, outgoing)` lane pair, building one RNE `TrafficSignal` group per
  link and one phase per parsed phase (the phase-state character at a link
  index becomes the group's aspect). The `signalized_cross` fixture (20 s
  green northbound, then 15 s green eastbound) drives RNE stop-line control: a
  scenario actor on the eastbound approach is held at the red stop line with
  zero violations. Unsignalized networks still import without signals.
- **SUMO networks drive scenario runs**: a run manifest's OpenSCENARIO
  `LogicFile` may reference a SUMO `.net.xml` directly; `rne-asset run` imports
  it through `rne_sumo` (deriving topology) instead of loading a
  `.rne.traffic.json`. `assets/runs/sumo_cross.rne.run.toml` spawns a vehicle
  on the imported `minimal_cross.net.xml` fixture and drives it toward the
  intersection (206 m route at 10 m/s, no collisions); tests pin the route
  derivation, the run, and determinism.
- **TCP runner control endpoint** (`rne-asset run --control-port PORT`): the
  interactive control channel (`pause`, `resume`, `step N`, `reset`, `quit`)
  is also served over a local TCP connection for a GUI/frontend. On connect
  the runner sends `ready paused protocol=1`, acknowledges each accepted
  command with `ok <state>`, and streams
  `status step=<n> t=<t> state=<state> snapshot=<json>` after every step
  through `rne_core::RunnerControl::report_status`. A process-level test drives
  the binary over TCP and verifies the protocol and resulting replay.
- **Plugin authoring tooling**: `rne_plugin::scaffold_controller_plugin` generates
  a complete, compilable controller-plugin crate (a `cdylib` implementing the
  controller-plugin C ABI, initially a velocity-servo policy) plus a versioned
  `rne-plugin.json` manifest. `rne-asset plugin new <name> --dir <parent>`
  scaffolds it; `rne-asset plugin list --path <dir>` enumerates built-in and
  discoverable plugin libraries (`rne_plugin::discover_plugin_names`). An
  end-to-end test scaffolds, builds, and loads a plugin from the generated
  source, verifying the name, ABI version, and velocity-servo commands.
- **SUMO `.net.xml` road-network import** (`rne_sumo`): an offline importer that
  converts SUMO `edge`/`lane` geometry and `allow`/`disallow` road-user classes
  into the RNE Y-up frame (`[x, z, -y]`), skipping internal/connector edges, and
  derives junctions and lane connections deterministically through
  `rne_traffic::build_traffic_topology`. `rne-asset sumo-net` writes the
  resulting `.rne.traffic.json`. Fixture: `assets/networks/minimal_cross.net.xml`
  (four-way junction, seven movements). Malformed XML and shapes are rejected
  with clear errors.
- **Controller-plugin discovery by name**: the controller-plugin C ABI is now
  version 2 and requires the plugin to export `rne_plugin_name` (a static
  NUL-terminated name), which the host uses as the loaded plugin's name.
  `rne_plugin::discover_controller_plugin` searches directories for a shared
  library whose file name contains the requested name and whose
  `rne_plugin_name` matches, deterministically, falling back to the built-in
  `velocity_servo` registry. Run manifests select it with
  `[controller] plugin_paths = [...]`. Discovery, not-found, and
  discovered-vs-built-in replay-identical tests pin the behavior.
- **Dynamically loaded controller plugins**: `rne_plugin::load_controller_library`
  opens a controller plugin from a shared library through a versioned C ABI
  (`rne_plugin_abi_version`, `rne_controller_create`, `rne_controller_destroy`,
  `rne_controller_step`; `#[repr(C)]` observations/commands, NUL-terminated
  UTF-8 strings). ABI-version mismatches and missing symbols are rejected at
  load time. `rne_plugin_example_velocity_servo` is a minimal `cdylib` reference
  implementation that drives the same policy as the built-in
  `VelocityServoController`; a run manifest selects it with
  `[controller] kind = "plugin"` plus `library = "..."`. Loading, create-error,
  and determinism (loaded vs built-in replay-identical) tests pin the behavior.
- **Interactive runner control** (`rne-asset run --control-stdin`): a
  transport-neutral control state machine in `rne_core::control` drives the
  fixed-step loop with `pause`, `resume`, `step N`, `reset`, and `quit`
  commands on stdin. `reset` rebuilds the world from the episode's initial
  conditions; `step N` advances exactly N frames then pauses. The runner starts
  paused awaiting the first command, so piped scripts are timing-independent.
  stdin EOF while paused quits the run, determinism re-checks are skipped in
  interactive mode, and `--replay-out PATH` overrides the manifest's replay path.
- **Controller-plugin boundary** (`rne_plugin`): plugin manifests and a
  `ControllerPlugin` trait separate policy implementations from the runner.
  Run manifests select a plugin with `[controller] kind = "plugin"`; the
  built-in `VelocityServoController` maps observed joint positions to velocity
  commands each step. Deterministic replay records the plugin actions.
  Example: `assets/runs/mm_minimal_velocity_servo.rne.run.toml`.
- **OpenSCENARIO vehicle catalogs**: `CatalogLocations` `VehicleCatalog`
  directories are resolved relative to the scenario file, and
  `ScenarioObject` `CatalogReference` entries are looked up in the catalog
  files (scanned deterministically). Catalog references without a base
  directory are rejected. Parser tests pin the resolution.
- **OpenSCENARIO assigned-route actions**: the importer parses
  `AssignRouteAction` waypoints and the executor builds a polyline route from
  them, snapping the actor onto it at the scheduled time (each action applies
  once). Parser and deterministic execution tests pin the behavior.
- **Network signal timing in scenario runs**: the OpenSCENARIO executor derives
  stop-line controls from the road network's `TrafficSignal` fixed-time
  programs and advances their aspects each step, so actors stop at red and
  proceed on green. A signaled-corridor test pins the delay, zero red-line
  violations, and determinism.
- **OpenSCENARIO parameter substitution**: `ParameterDeclarations` values are
  substituted into `${name}` references before parsing, so action targets can
  be parameterized. Duplicate declarations are rejected.
- **OpenSCENARIO lane-change actions**: the importer parses `LateralAction`
  `LaneChangeAction` `RelativeTargetLane` events and the executor switches the
  actor to a synthetic parallel route (one lane width lateral, snapped) at the
  scheduled time. Deterministic lane-change and parser tests pin the behavior.
- **Second physics backend** (`rne_physics_analytic`): a deterministic,
  collision-free analytic backend (semi-implicit Euler gravity integration for
  dynamic rigid bodies) that implements the backend-neutral `PhysicsBackend`
  trait. Run manifests select the backend with `[physics] backend =
  "rapier" | "analytic"` and negotiate `required_capabilities` against it.
  Free-fall, determinism, fixed-body, capability, and empty-contact tests pin
  the behavior. Example: `assets/runs/cart_analytic.rne.run.toml`.
- **Physics capability negotiation**: `rne_physics::require_capabilities`
  verifies a backend's declared capabilities against a required set and reports
  the missing ones; run manifests can declare `[physics]
  required_capabilities = [...]` and `rne-asset run` fails with a clear error
  before executing if the backend cannot satisfy them. Rapier now also declares
  `deterministic_step` and `contact_force`.
- **Minimal MuJoCo MJCF model importer** (`rne_mjcf`): converts a strict MJCF
  subset (one root body tree, `hinge`/`slide` joints with `axis`/`range` under
  the `compiler` degree or radian convention, and `box`/`sphere`/`cylinder`
  geoms with `pos`/`rgba`) into a URDF document the existing `rne_urdf_import`
  pipeline consumes. Body/geom rotations, free/ball/universal joints, meshes,
  and capsules are rejected with a clear error. Golden and round-trip tests pin
  the emitted URDF.
- **Minimal SDF model importer** (`rne_sdf`): converts a strict Gazebo SDF
  subset (a single `<model>` of links with inertial/visual/collision geometry
  and revolute/continuous/prismatic/fixed joints) into a URDF document that the
  existing `rne_urdf_import` pipeline consumes. Worlds, multiple models,
  link/model `<pose>`, and unsupported geometry are rejected with a clear error.
  Golden and round-trip tests pin the emitted URDF.
- **Multi-joint position trajectories**: run manifests can use a
  `joint_trajectory` controller that interpolates time-indexed position
  waypoints per named joint; the runner records the interpolated targets as the
  frame action and they replay deterministically. Example:
  `assets/runs/mm_minimal_joint_trajectory.rne.run.toml`.
- **OpenSCENARIO run manifests**: run manifests can reference a scenario with
  `[scenario] xosc = "..."` (the manifest `scene` then becomes optional), and
  `rne-asset run` parses the OpenSCENARIO file, loads the road network from its
  `LogicFile`, executes the scenario over the traffic runtime, and verifies
  determinism when configured. Example: `assets/runs/scenario_speed.rne.run.toml`.
- **OpenSCENARIO scenario executor**: `rne_openscenario` now executes a
  scenario document over the traffic runtime  Eit derives an actor-compatible
  route from the road network, spawns the scenario entities as traffic actors,
  and applies each timed `AbsoluteSpeed` action while stepping the deterministic
  kinematic traffic systems. Deterministic replay tests pin the outcome.
- **Minimal OpenSCENARIO 1.0 importer** (`rne_openscenario`): parses a strict
  OpenSCENARIO 1.0 subset  E`FileHeader` 1.0, `RoadNetwork/LogicFile` road
  reference, `Entities` vehicles/bicycles/pedestrians, `Init` teleport spawn
  poses, and storyboard `SpeedAction` events with `AbsoluteTargetSpeed` and a
  `SimulationTimeCondition`  Einto a versioned `.rne.scenario.json` document.
  Unsupported elements are rejected with a clear error; golden and round-trip
  tests pin the canonical JSON.
- **Contact and failure annotations**: the replay artifact now records per-step
  contact statistics (active pair count, summed and max normal impulse) and the
  final report annotates the run outcome with the maximum concurrent contact
  pairs, the largest per-step contact impulse, the minimum base height, and a
  `fell` failure when the first robot base drops below half its initial height.
  `rne-asset simulate`/`run` print the annotations and the browser replay
  inspector shows them per frame and in the report.
- **Full typed sensor payload export**: run manifests can request full IMU,
  LiDAR, camera (RGB+D), or wheel-encoder payload capture with `[[sensors]]`
  subscriptions (by entity name or kind). The `.rne-replay` artifact stores the
  complete typed payload per frame next to the existing stream summaries, and
  `rne-asset simulate`/`run` accept `--sensor-name` / `--sensor-kind`. Replay
  verification continues to check the exact payload hashes; the browser replay
  inspector summarizes captured payloads. See `docs/OSS_PARITY.md`.
- **Photoreal industrial environment package (v0.3-J)**: examples 70 and 71
  now default to a provenance-pinned CC0 Poly Haven Machine Shop HDRI and
  Hand Truck glTF prop, exercise the existing PBR/glTF material path, and keep
  procedural calibration-room and lighting fallbacks behind explicit
  environment variables. The asset directory records source URLs, authors,
  licenses, upstream MD5 values, and local SHA-256 hashes.
- **Photoreal Unitree G1 RGB-D sensor loop (v0.3-I)**: example 71 mounts the
  existing renderer-independent `CameraSpec` pipeline on G1 `head_link`,
  publishes paired RGB/depth frames through DataBus with deterministic optical
  effects and simulation latency, writes RGB/depth/manifest capture artifacts,
  and validates replay hashes in the workspace smoke gate.
- **Photoreal Unitree G1 capture (v0.3-H)**: example 70 now resolves the
  official Unitree G1 URDF/STL visual hierarchy through the existing physics
  world and `MeshRenderCache`, adds a PBR calibration room with floor normal/
  roughness maps, supports optional HDRI/TAA, writes PNG/GIF captures, and
  runs a headless mesh-resolution smoke in CI.
- **Photoreal humanoid asset integration (v0.3-G)**: the pinned and attributed
  Khronos Rigged Figure GLB now drives example 69 through the glTF scene loader,
  deterministic animation player, material/texture propagation, and WGPU color
  plus shadow skinning. `--smoke` validates the asset and GPU payload without a
  renderer; the default example writes two rendered animation frames. The
  workspace smoke gate runs the GPU-free asset check on every CI pass.
- **Photoreal environment lighting (v0.3-B)**: `rne_render` now loads
  Radiance `.hdr` equirectangular maps as validated linear RGB32F data, while
  `rne_render_wgpu` provides opt-in sky, diffuse IBL, and view-dependent
  specular IBL with configurable intensity and world-Y rotation. The G1
  photoreal capture accepts `RNE_HDRI_PATH`, `RNE_HDRI_INTENSITY`, and
  `RNE_HDRI_ROTATION_RAD`; no third-party HDRI is vendored.
- **Photoreal temporal anti-aliasing (v0.3-C)**: `rne_render_wgpu` now
  provides opt-in deterministic Halton camera jitter, depth-based reprojection,
  neighborhood history clamping, resize-safe accumulation, and G1 capture
  controls through `RNE_TAA`, `RNE_TAA_FEEDBACK`, and `RNE_TAA_JITTER_PX`.
- **Photoreal prefiltered IBL (v0.3-D)**: HDR environment uploads now build
  deterministic GGX/Hammersley specular mip levels and a cosine-weighted
  diffuse environment map. WGPU material shading selects specular blur from
  roughness while the original HDR map remains the sky source.
- **Photoreal humanoid motion (v0.3-E)**: `rne_render::load_gltf_scene` now
  preserves glTF node hierarchies, inverse-bind skins, four-influence vertex
  weights, and linear/step TRS animation clips. `GltfSceneAsset::sample_part`
  produces deterministic bind-pose-safe CPU-deformed meshes for the existing
  dynamic-mesh render path; cubic-spline animation and morph targets remain
  explicit unsupported cases.
- **Photoreal GPU skinning (v0.3-F)**: `GltfAnimationPlayer` and
  `GltfSceneAsset::sample_part_for_gpu` provide simulation-driven bind-pose
  meshes with joint matrices and weights. `rne_render_wgpu` uploads those
  payloads through storage buffers and applies them in both the color and
  shadow passes.
- **PLATEAU city-drive visual realism**: Example 46 now generates a licensed
  90-meter, ten-building PLATEAU-style showcase and renders varied facades,
  sidewalks, curbs, lane markings, a crossing, trees, and streetlights. The
  shared orbit camera now keeps world `+Y` upright, eliminating follow-camera
  roll, and the regenerated eight-second driving GIF uses a daylight city view.
- **PLATEAU road traffic realism**: `tran:Road` LOD1 surfaces now become
  deterministic road meshes and stable derived two-way lane metadata. A bounded
  SimClock-driven Ackermann model supplies acceleration, braking, steering-rate
  limits, pure-pursuit control, and explicit invalid-command behavior. Example
  46 drives both cars from imported lanes with rotating and steering wheels.
- **PLATEAU import Phase 1**: a ROS2-free offline `rne_plateau` pipeline and
  `rne-plateau-import` CLI convert bounded CityGML building LOD1 solids into
  deterministic per-building OBJ meshes, an ordinary RNE scene, and stable
  `gml:id` metadata. Geographic and projected coordinates map to local-meter
  Y-up space, building AABBs provide inexpensive static headless collision,
  and a synthetic CC0 fixture covers byte-identical replay and scene spawning.
  Example 46 renders a deterministic drone traversal plus two-way car traffic.
- **Robot Behavior CI Phase 1**: backend-neutral typed `Always`, `Eventually`,
  and `Consecutive` contracts in `rne_ai`; deterministic ascending multi-seed
  execution; first-violation diagnostics with stable entity names; versioned
  JSON and JUnit XML reports; and `cargo run -p xtask -- behavior-ci`. The
  initial headless G1 + Dex3 scenario checks grasp-contact stability, forbidden
  hand/workcell contact, a simulation-time acquisition deadline, finite
  observations, and bounded payload motion. A real successful seed and an
  intentionally invalid tray layout cover both report outcomes.
- **Friction-based grasp core (v0.14 Phase B)**: opt-in `GraspMode::Friction` on
  `MobileManipulatorSim` (`set_grasp_mode`) holds a grasped object with
  force-limited finger squeeze and surface friction only  Eno weld joint is
  inserted, the object stays a free rigid body, and the grasp drops when both
  fingers stop bearing load for 5 consecutive steps (or on an open command).
  The finger motors get a 1.0 N·m force cap in friction mode so the squeeze
  saturates at the object surface instead of wedging through it. Weld remains
  the default mode: all existing scenes, tests, and the README hero trajectory
  digest are bit-for-bit unchanged. Supporting plumbing: `ContactEvent` now
  carries the pair's accumulated normal-impulse magnitude from Rapier's solver
  (`impulse`, N·s per step), and scene TOML obstacles accept an optional
  `friction` coefficient override  Eused by the new tests to prove a µ=0.02
  cube slips out of the same grasp that carries a µ=0.5 cube.
- **Friction-grasp task migration (v0.14 Phase C)**: continued-close policies
  now converge on a bounded 15-step pinch target instead of winding the finger
  springs into a geometric jam. The fixed-base clutter policy/E2E and Python RL
  clutter/place rollouts select friction mode after reset; policy observations
  remain in carry/place coordinates across the friction grasp's debounced drop
  semantics. Weld remains available for scripted regression trajectories.

### Changed

- **Reproducible release gates**: GitHub Actions and local `xtask ci` use the
  repository's Rust 1.95 toolchain and locked dependency graph. Headless and
  default 10-seed Behavior CI are independent required jobs; the full local
  gate also includes headless, OSS parity, and Behavior CI stages.
- **Bounded runner transport**: protocol-v1 TCP writes have a finite timeout,
  opt-in source RGB-D is capped at 1920x1080 per image, source and transmitted
  dimensions are explicit, and snapshots above 32 MiB become a compact limit
  status instead of an unbounded socket write.
- **Explicit external traffic ownership**: co-simulated actors carry
  `TrafficPoseSource::External`, so native traffic systems do not advance poses
  owned by SUMO while native actors retain deterministic kinematic ownership.

### Known limitations

- **Mobile friction placement**: `mm_mobile` can acquire a physical friction
  grasp, but its planar arm has no vertical lift. The existing mobile place
  policy relies on a weld to drag the cube along the long tabletop before it
  falls clear; a free friction-held cube loses contact during that maneuver.
  Example 34 therefore validates friction grasp acquisition while its complete
  transport/place trajectory remains a v0.15 robot/scene redesign task.

### Fixed

- **Transactional TraCI synchronization**: a co-simulation step now reads and
  validates every sorted SUMO vehicle position before mutating ECS or the actor
  index. A late position error therefore cannot partially update existing
  actors or spawn only a prefix of the new vehicle set.
- **`mm_mobile` arm servo sway**: base motion alone (a yaw turn, or a driving
  turn like the hero pick approach) back-drove the uncommanded shoulder/elbow
  position hold by up to ~0.30 rad  Ethe base's yaw acceleration couples the
  outboard arm chain's full inertia into the joints, and the shared 400/60
  spring constants (tuned for command tracking) are far too soft to resist it,
  so the swinging arm bulldozed tabletop objects during driving approaches.
  The mobile robot's shoulder/elbow now switch to a near-critically-damped
  4000/127 position hold while uncommanded (velocity-commanded moves, and the
  fixed-base robots, keep the original tracking dynamics), cutting the
  back-drive to ~0.034 rad. The hero rollout's pre-grasp cube nudge and its
  regression bound tighten accordingly.

- **README hero capture**: the hero GIF's task cube was a render-only decoration
  keyframe-lerped into the gripper at a hardcoded step  Eit visibly flew ~1.5 m
  through the air into a gripper that never approached it, and slid ~0.74 m back
  to the place target after release. The cube is now a real dynamic body in a new
  `mm_mobile_hero` scene (physical pick table + place tray), picked by the actual
  two-finger contact-gated grasp weld via an observation-gated approach ↁEgrasp ↁE  retreat ↁEcarry ↁErelease policy, and dropped onto the tray by physics. New
  smoke regression guards: pre-grasp object displacement, post-release slide,
  real `is_grasping()` grasp duration.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **`train_mobile_clutter.py`**: CEM smoke on the pinned `mobile_clutter_pick_place_center`
  episode (`mm_mobile_clutter` scene, `clutter_cube_a`). Re-implements
  `IkMobileClutterPickPlacePolicy`'s observation-gated phase machine (settle, pick drive,
  retreat, carry drive, release) in Python, with CEM tuning the pick-phase gripper rate
  and the pick/retreat/carry drive speeds against a weak baseline that holds the gripper
  open (structurally unable to grasp); asserts improvement margin, grasp, and deterministic
  replay of the best candidate.
- **`train_mobile_clutter_ppo.py`**: SB3 PPO integration smoke on `mobile_clutter_place_center`.
- **Mobile clutter place E2E**: `IkMobileClutterPickPlacePolicy` now completes the full
  navigate ↁEgrasp ↁEplace loop on `mm_mobile_clutter` (observation-gated phases: poke-grasp
  drive, straight retreat that drags the welded object clear of the tabletop contact wedge,
  carry drive that parks the object over the target, object-over-target release gate). The
  two mobile clutter E2E tests run un-ignored, and example 34 places `clutter_cube_a` on the
  ground target.

### Fixed

- **`mm_mobile` asset**: gripper base and finger links had no collision geometry (fingers could
  never articulate or trigger the contact-weld grasp), and the chassis/arm collision boxes
  interpenetrated, locking the shoulder and elbow joints solid. Colliders added and arm-chain
  collision boxes trimmed for clearance; `mm_mobile_clutter` table lowered to the lift-less
  arm's fixed shoulder plane.
- **Mobile base sim**: the diff-drive base pose is now integrated kinematically from the
  commanded twist after each physics step (heading extracted by planar projection instead of
  Euler yaw, which aliased transient contact tilt into corrupted headings), making drive
  phases deterministic; mobile arm joints use position-hold motors with an anti-windup lead
  and the mobile world runs at the lift robot's solver iteration count.
- **`mm_minimal` settle physics (linux CI)**: the fixed-base SCARA arm never settled  Eits
  chassis/arm colliders interpenetrated (injecting contact energy every tick) and its
  shoulder/elbow were bare velocity motors with no restoring force, so the idle pose was a
  sustained chaotic oscillation that merely sampled differently per platform. The arm now
  mirrors the mm_mobile fix (collision boxes trimmed, spring-damper position-hold motors,
  anti-windup lead) and settles to a true equilibrium (shoulder/elbow within mrad of zero,
  identical on Windows and Linux). Fixed-base grasp welds seat the object 2 cm upward so a
  horizontal carry does not fight the object's pinned support contact; the clutter cubes and
  the fixed-base place targets were re-derived against the stable dynamics (the old layouts
  were only reachable through the unstable arm's joint stretch); the mobile clutter carry
  steers the carried object (not the base) onto the place target so its platform-dependent
  carry offset no longer skips the release gate. All eight formerly linux-gated tests
  (seven in `rne_ai`, one in `rne_py`) and the example 26/33 + `run.py` smokes now run
  un-gated on all platforms. The README hero live-digest comparison stays Windows-only:
  cross-platform contact dynamics are outcome-stable, not bit-identical.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`MmMinimalKinematics`**: analytic FK/IK for the fixed-base `mm_minimal` SCARA arm
  (`mm_minimal_kinematics.rs`), with roundtrip tests, sim XZ parity, and reachability helper.
- **`IkClutterPickPlacePolicy`**: IK approach + tuned fixed-velocity carry toward
  `mm_minimal_clutter_place_target` (fixed-base ground target off the table edge).
  Example 33 `--smoke` asserts grasp and place on `clutter_cube_b`; 15 clutter unit
  tests cover grasp, carry tuning, and full scripted place E2E.
- **`train_clutter.py`**: CEM smoke on the `clutter_place_center` episode (approach reward +
  place progress, grasp assertion, deterministic replay on the best candidate).
- **`train_clutter_ppo.py`**: SB3 PPO integration smoke on `clutter_place_center`.
- **`clutter_pick_place_center`**: pinned center-cube config for reproducible clutter RL benches.
- **`IkMobileClutterPickPlacePolicy`**: diff-drive approach + IK arm pick/place for
  `mm_mobile_clutter` (example 34; full place E2E still tuning).
- **`mm_mobile_clutter_place_target`**: shared ground place target helper for mobile clutter episodes.
- **`mobile_clutter_pick_place_center`**: pinned `clutter_cube_a` config for mobile RL benches.
- **`xtask ci`**: runs `train_clutter.py` / `train_clutter_ppo.py --smoke` alongside existing RL smokes.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`ImageDepth` DataBus payload** and paired wrist RGB-D sampling (`sample_camera_rgbd`,
  scene-aware headless depth via `scene_depth_probe`).
- **Wrist depth observations**: `wrist_depth_center_m`, `wrist_depth_min_m`, and
  `target_object_index` on `MobileManipulatorObservation` (Python bindings included).
- **`VisuomotorReachPolicy`**: goal-conditioned reach that scales arm velocity from wrist depth.
- **Clutter pick-and-place episodes**: `clutter_pick_place` and `mobile_clutter_pick_place`
  configs with `mm_minimal_clutter` / `mm_mobile_clutter` scenes; pre-grasp approach reward
  on Place tasks.
- **RL bench scripts**: `train_place.py` (CEM place smoke) and `train_visuomotor.py`
  (depth-conditioned reach smoke).
- **`xtask ci`**: validates clutter scenes and runs `rne_py` RL smokes (`run.py`,
  `train_place.py`, `train_visuomotor.py`, `train_ppo.py`).
- **`IkLiftPickPlacePolicy`**: pick-and-place state machine whose carry swing solves
  [`MmLiftKinematics`] targets and drives shoulder / elbow / lift at a fixed rate toward
  the IK joint solution. Example 31 and the `lift_pick_place` episode test use this
  policy; [`LiftPickPlacePolicy`] remains for scripted regression tests.
- **ROS 2 `mm_lift` mode** (`RNE_ROS2_MODE=mm_lift`): loads the `mm_lift` scene and exposes
  manipulator subscriptions including `/lift_command` and `/arm_joint_trajectory`.
- **3-DOF lift-arm trajectories**: when `lift_joint`, `shoulder_joint`, and `elbow_joint`
  appear in `/arm_joint_trajectory` or `/arm_joint_position`, the bridge drives
  `MobileManipulatorAction::hold_lift_joints` waypoint following.

### Fixed

- **Depth stream id**: `rne_ai` wrist depth uses `rne_sensor::CAMERA_DEPTH_STREAM_OFFSET`
  (single source of truth).
- **Place / reach progress rewards**: potential-based shaping (signed delta) instead of
  clamping progress at zero.
- **Mobile manipulator snapshot v2**: adds `wrist_depth_frame`; schema v1 checkpoints restore
  with `wrist_depth_frame` absent (`#[serde(default)]`).
- **Clutter scenes**: tabletop support in `mm_minimal_clutter` (cubes settle on table, stay clear
  of idle arm sweep); E2E covers gripper contact on all targets, weld grasp of the center cube,
  transport Place script parity, and mobile-base approach.
- **`xtask ci`**: pinned Python deps in `requirements-ci.txt` (CPU-only torch, gymnasium, SB3);
  set `RNE_SKIP_RL_SMOKES` to skip RL smokes locally.
- **`rne_py` checkpoint tests**: tolerate JSON float roundtrip on episode rewards.
- **RL smokes**: deterministic `random.seed(0)`; CEM smokes check best-iteration improvement
  (`max(history) > history[0]`).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`MmLiftKinematics`**: analytic forward / inverse kinematics for the `mm_lift`
  column + 2R arm chain (pure, deterministic, seed-free). Matches the simulation
  shoulder sign convention. Tests: `fk_ik_roundtrip_for_reachable_targets`,
  `fk_matches_sim_at_idle`, `fk_shoulder_sign_matches_positive_velocity_swing`.
- **Direct lift-arm joint targets**: `MobileManipulatorAction::lift_joint_target`,
  `MobileManipulatorAction::hold_lift_joints()`, and
  `MobileManipulatorSim::set_lift_joint_targets()` drive lift / shoulder / elbow
  position motors to absolute targets (with raised stiffness for direct holds).
- **Joint-space trajectory helpers**: `JointTrajectory`, `joint_tracking_action`,
  and `hold_lift_joint_action` for position-motor tracking. Test
  `ik_reaches_arbitrary_target`.
- **`rne_py` IK bindings**: `MmLiftKinematics`, `MmLiftJointTarget`,
  `MmLiftGripperTarget`, `MobileManipulatorSim(mode="mm_lift")`,
  `step_hold_lift_joints()` on sim and episode, and `lift_position_m` on
  observations.

### Changed

- **`LiftPickPlacePolicy`**: exposes `kinematics()` and `default_place_target()` for
  IK-based controllers; carry swing remains the proven scripted shoulder rate until
  IK carry converges reliably under grasp load.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **README 3D pick-and-place showcase**: a sim-captured hero still of the `mm_lift` robot
  hoisting a grasped cube, generated by the new `32_lift_pick_place_hero` example, plus an
  updated highlights/feature list and run commands for the pick-and-place.

- **ROS 2 `/lift_command` topic**: the ROS 2 node now subscribes to `std_msgs/Float64` on
  `/lift_command` to drive the vertical lift (positive raises, negative lowers), alongside
  the existing `/cmd_vel`, `/gripper_command`, and arm topics. Verified by the ci-ros2 smoke.

- **`LiftPickPlacePolicy`**: a reusable scripted pick-and-place policy (state machine) for
  the `mm_lift` robot  Elower ↁEgrasp ↁElift ↁEswing ↁEsettle ↁElower ↁErelease. It implements
  `Policy<MobileManipulatorEpisode>` and is now the single source for the pick-and-place
  trajectory used by example 31 and the episode test (previously duplicated inline).
- **Configurable place location**: `LiftPickPlacePolicy::with_swing_steps` sets how far the
  carry swing rotates the arm, so the cube can be placed at different spots around the column
  (`total_steps()` reports the sequence length). Test `lift_place_swing_controls_drop_location`.

### Changed

- **Place tasks now expose a goal offset in the observation** (`target_d{x,y,z}_m`): before
  grasping it points from the gripper to the object (where to pick), and once grasped it
  points from the object to the place target (where to carry). Previously these were always
  zero for Place tasks, leaving a policy blind; this makes the pick-and-place observation-
  driven. Test `place_observation_points_at_object_then_target`.

### Added

- **Interactive viewer `--manipulator-lift` profile**: the redesigned `mm_lift` robot is now
  viewable/teleoperable in example 14, with `R` / `F` driving the vertical lift. Wired into
  `xtask ci` as a render smoke.

- **Lift pick-and-place episode** (`MobileManipulatorEpisodeConfig::lift_pick_place`): the
  full 3D pick-and-place as a first-class `Episode` (reward + success), on the `mm_lift_pick`
  scene with a place target. Exposed to Python as `MobileManipulatorEpisode("lift_place")`.
  The Python episode `step` now accepts a `lift_velocity_m_s` argument (default `0.0`, so
  existing 5-argument calls are unchanged) to drive the vertical lift. Test
  `lift_pick_place_episode_picks_carries_and_places`.

- **Full 3D pick-and-place** (manipulator-redesign phase 4, final): the `mm_lift` robot now
  performs an end-to-end pick→lift→carry→place  Elower the top-down claw over a ground cube,
  grasp it, lift it, swing the arm to a new spot, lower it, and open to release. Test
  `lift_picks_carries_and_places_cube` and example
  `31_mobile_manipulator_lift_pick_place` (carries the cube ~1.1 m and releases it; wired
  into `xtask ci`). This completes the four-phase manipulator redesign (column base ↁE  controllable arm ↁEtop-down claw ↁEpick-and-place).

- **Real 3D pick** (manipulator-redesign phase 3): the `mm_lift` gripper is redesigned as a
  **top-down claw** (two fingers hang down to straddle an object) so it can lower over a cube
  on the ground, grasp it (contact-triggered weld), and the lift raises it off the ground  E  the previous side-grip could not pick a ground object because its body collided with it.
  New `mm_lift_pick` scene + `mm_lift_pick_scene_path()` and test
  `lift_picks_cube_off_ground_and_raises_it`.

- **Per-motor force override** (`JointMotor.max_force`, default `0.0` = use the
  per-joint-type cap): a positive value overrides the cap for that motor, e.g. a heavy
  arm joint that needs more torque to track its target.

### Changed

- **Lift robot arm is now controllable** (manipulator-redesign phase 2): the arm revolute
  joints are position (spring-damper) motors with a raised torque cap, so the heavy arm
  moves to a commanded angle and *holds* it  Ea plain velocity motor was too weak to move
  or hold it. Fixed a geometry bug where the upper arm overlapped the carriage and jammed
  the shoulder; the arm now also settles perfectly straight. New test
  `lift_arm_tracks_and_holds_commanded_pose`.

- **Lift robot can now lower its gripper to the ground** (manipulator-redesign phase 1):
  `mm_lift` is rebuilt on a tall fixed **column** with the arm hanging from a sliding
  carriage, so the lift lowers the gripper from rest (~0.81 m) down to near ground
  (~0.26 m) and raises it to carry  Ethe previous box base let the lift only go up. The
  arm also settles much straighter. New test `lift_lowers_gripper_toward_ground`; existing
  lift tests/smoke unchanged in intent.

### Added

- **Per-world solver iterations** (`PhysicsWorldDesc.solver_iterations`, default `0` =
  Rapier's default): a higher count stabilizes stiff articulated chains. The `mm_lift`
  robot's world uses 16 iterations so its tall lift+arm chain holds its pose instead of
  swinging chaotically (it was unstable at the default); other robots are unchanged.
  Covered by a new idle-pose-hold test.

- **Vertical lift (`mm_lift` robot)**: a fixed-base arm with a prismatic "torso" lift
  between the base and shoulder, so the whole SCARA arm can be raised and lowered.
  `MobileManipulatorSim::new_mm_lift()` loads it; `MobileManipulatorAction.lift_velocity_m_s`
  drives the lift (other robots ignore it). The lift is a **position (spring-damper) motor**,
  so it holds the ~6 kg arm against gravity at a commanded height without drift  Evertical
  lifting was previously blocked by the velocity-only motor. Covered by a unit test
  (controllable, reversible vertical motion) and a replay-determinism test.
- **Example 30 lift smoke**: `30_mobile_manipulator_lift` raises the `mm_lift` arm with
  the vertical lift and checks the end-effector rises (wired into `xtask ci`)
- **Joint position motors**: `JointMotor` gains `stiffness` + `target_position` fields
  (both default `0.0`, so existing velocity motors are unchanged). A positive stiffness
  turns a joint into a spring-damper that holds a position target under load.
- **Tunable motor gain**: `JointMotor.gain` (default `1.0`) scales the velocity-tracking
  damping factor instead of the previously hardcoded `1.0`, letting a joint track its target
  more stiffly under load. Prismatic motors also get a higher force cap (150 N vs the 50 N
  revolute cap) so a lift can hold a multi-link arm.
- **Reach curriculum** (`MobileManipulatorEpisodeConfig::reach_curriculum` + `ReachCurriculum`):
  an easy→hard curriculum that widens the goal-conditioned reach target region as the
  policy accumulates successes; exposed to Python as `MobileManipulatorEpisode("reach_curriculum")`
  with a `curriculum_stage` getter
- **Example 29 curriculum smoke**: a goal-conditioned policy advances the reach curriculum
  to its final stage (wired into `xtask ci`)
- **Determinism test** for the mobile manipulator reach episode (replay world-state hash)
- **Goal-conditioned reach** (`MobileManipulatorEpisodeConfig::reach_randomized`): a fresh
  reachable target is sampled each episode and exposed in the observation as
  `target_d{x,y,z}_m`, so a policy must generalize. Exposed to Python as
  `MobileManipulatorEpisode("reach_random")`; example 27 `train.py` now learns a
  goal-conditioned policy across varied targets, and the gym env includes the goal offset.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **`MobileManipulatorEpisodeConfig::reach()`** dense-reward reach task (exposed to Python
  as `MobileManipulatorEpisode("reach")`); target placed so it needs active control
- **Example 27 training loop** (`train.py`): Cross-Entropy-Method policy optimization that
  learns the reach task end-to-end with no external deps (mean reward ~2 ↁE~12)
- **`VectorizedMobileManipulatorEnv`**: batched mobile-manipulator episodes for
  population-based / parallel RL rollouts (parity with `VectorizedDiffDriveEnv`), with
  example 28 evaluating a policy population in lock-step
- **`rne_py.VectorizedMobileManipulatorEnv`**: Python binding for the batched env; the
  example 27 CEM training loop now evaluates each candidate population through it
- **Example 27 `train_ppo.py`**: Stable-Baselines3 PPO integration on the reach gym env
  (the `train.py` CEM loop remains the dependency-free deterministic learning demo)
- **Prismatic joints**: `rne_physics::PrismaticJointDesc` + Rapier linear motor; URDF
  `type="prismatic"` joints now wire into the articulation (`UrdfArticulationAttached.prismatic_joints`)
- **Fixed (weld) joints**: `rne_physics::FixedJointDesc` welds a child to a parent at a
  relative pose; the Rapier backend creates and *removes* the joint as the component is
  inserted/dropped (release)
- **Contact-triggered grasping**: `MobileManipulatorSim` welds a graspable body to the
  end-effector when the gripper closes on it and releases it on open
  (`is_grasping`, `grasped_object`)
- **`MobileManipulatorTask::Place`** and **`MobileManipulatorEpisodeConfig::place()`**:
  pick up a cube, carry it, and set it down at a target location
- **Example 26 pick-and-place smoke**: full grasp ↁEcarry ↁErelease ↁEsettle cycle
- **`rne_py` mobile manipulator bindings**: `MobileManipulatorSim` / `MobileManipulatorEpisode`
  (place / transport / inspect) exposed to Python with `is_grasping`
- **Example 27 RL env**: gymnasium-style `MobileManipulatorPlaceEnv` wrapper + scripted
  smoke (degrades gracefully without `gymnasium` / `numpy`)
- **ROS 2 `/gripper_command`** (`std_msgs/Float64`): drives the gripper in
  `mobile_manipulator` mode (negative closes/grasps, positive opens/releases)
- **ROS 2 `ee_link` TF frame**: end-effector pose published on `/tf` relative to `base_link`
- **ROS 2 `/arm_joint_position`** (`sensor_msgs/JointState`): position-control the arm  E  the node drives `shoulder_joint` / `elbow_joint` toward the commanded positions with a
  clamped P-controller (a velocity command cancels the target)
- **ROS 2 `/arm_joint_trajectory`** (`trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory`): follow a sequence
  of `shoulder_joint` / `elbow_joint` waypoints, advancing to the next when the current one
  is reached

### Fixed

- **ROS 2 node build**: `sensor_msgs/Image.is_bigendian` type mismatch (`bool` ↁE`u8`)
  that broke `rne_ros2_node` compilation
- **`mm_mobile` drive wheels**: wheel joints were stacked vertically (`xyz="0 ±0.225 0"`)
  so only one wheel touched the ground and the base spun in place; relocated to a proper
  left/right diff-drive layout (`xyz="0 -0.15 ±0.225"`) so the base drives forward
- **URDF fixed joints**: were not wired to a physics joint, so a fixed-joint child link
  silently became a free-falling body; now wired as a rigid `FixedJointDesc` weld
  (recalibrated the affected `mm_minimal` reach/place demo targets)

### Changed

- **Deterministic physics backend iteration**: the Rapier backend now syncs bodies and
  joints (and writes transforms back) in a stable entity order, fixing run-to-run
  nondeterminism (previously flaky `shoulder_motor_moves_forearm`)
- **`xtask ci`**: example 26 pick-and-place smoke

- **`mm_minimal_grasp` scene** with tabletop cube obstacle
- **Example 22 grasp smoke**: finger contact with `grasp_cube` (`--smoke`)

### Changed

- **`new_mm_minimal` / `new_mm_mobile`** delegate to default scene assets
- **Interactive viewer**, **example 21**, and **ROS `mobile_manipulator` mode** load robots via scene paths
- **Viewer teleop**: `C` / `V` gripper close / open on manipulator profiles

- **Mobile base drive helpers** (`mm_mobile_twist_to_wheel_velocities`, unified wheel sign in `MobileManipulatorSim`)

### Changed

- **Rapier physics sync** uses composed world transforms for parent/child link hierarchies
- **`xtask ci`**: validates `mm_mobile` / `mm_minimal` assets; smokes examples 20, 21, and viewer `--manipulator-mobile`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **LiDAR render helpers** (`rne_render::lidar`): sphere markers for ray hits via `RenderScene::append_lidar_points`
- **LiDAR render example** (`19_lidar_render`): diff-drive scan visualized in wgpu

- **`world_transform_of()`** for composed URDF / parent-child render transforms

### Changed

- **`rne_urdf_import` moved to `crates/`** so core workspace CI no longer depends on `adapters/ros2/`
- **Rendering**: physics-synced bases use yaw-only rotation; orbit camera helpers live in `rne_render_wgpu::camera` (no winit required)
- **wgpu multi-draw fix**: per-item draw uniforms use dynamic offsets so multi-link URDF scenes render correctly
- **Depth readback** uses `TextureAspect::DepthOnly` for reliable off-screen passes

### Fixed

- URDF mesh scenes no longer disappear when child links carry local rotations
- Interactive viewer and headless examples frame robots with `CameraOrbit` instead of a fixed offset camera

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Shared-world agents** (`12_shared_world_agent`): agent entities live in the simulation ECS world and drive diff-drive robots in-place
- **Multi-robot simulation** (`13_multi_robot_agent`): multiple robots in one `DiffDriveSim`, batched stepping, per-robot policies

- **ROS 2 Python bridge CI**: `ros2-bridge.yml`, `xtask ci-ros2-bridge`, enhanced smoke test with `rne_py` build and topic checks
- **CI**: repo asset validation and spawn smoke in core `xtask ci`

### Changed

- Python ROS 2 bridge smoke aligned with native node (300 steps, `MIN_FORWARD_X_M = 0.8`)
- `rne_py` bindings expose extended diff-drive observation fields

### Notes

- Interactive viewer requires a display; use `--smoke` or `RNE_SKIP_GPU` in headless environments
- Asset hot reload tracks scene, robot, and URDF dependency files by modification time

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

### Changed

- Default diff-drive simulation uses joint-driven Rapier wheels (scene assets still use kinematic mode)
- README and roadmap refreshed for v0.2 feature set

### Notes

- Core CI remains ROS-free: `cargo run -p xtask -- ci`
- Native ROS node still builds outside the workspace with `--manifest-path` and patched message crates
- Python bridge unchanged in `adapters/ros2/rne_ros2_bridge/`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
